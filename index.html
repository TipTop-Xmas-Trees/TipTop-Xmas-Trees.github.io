        <h1>How we Donate to CTS</h1>
        <p>
            A portion of all proceeds will be donated to the Community Transitional School, an amazing school that
            supports children experiencing housing insecurity whether they are living in motels, shelters or elsewhere.
            They provide transportation to and from the school, two hot meals a day, clothing and dental care for all
            students who attend the school and more. As importantly, they provide a warm and supportive learning
            environment for the children facing these challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Approximately 90% of their funding comes from donors like you and me. Please visit their website to <a href="https://www.transitionalschool.org/our-programs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">learn
            more about their programs</a> and to <a href="https://www.transitionalschool.org/donate" rel="noopener" target="_blank">make an additional donation</a>.
