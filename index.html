        <p>
            TipTop Xmas Trees is located in the
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HollywoodGroceryOutlet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hollywood Grocery Outlet</a> parking lot at
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qJvNABVBnK8aFv3W8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NE 44th and Hancock</a>, a block off Sandy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of our trees are locally grown and freshly cut, by a local tree farming family in Estacada.
        </p>
        <p>
            Included in our selection are <i>natural trees</i>, which are grown without trimming and just cut as they grow for a natural look, and also <i>tabletop trees</i>, which are small enough to sit on a table.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hours may vary due to staffing and weather, but you will generally be able to rely on the Christmas tree lot being open the following hours:

        <h1 id="donate">‚ù§ Ô∏èDonate to CTS</h1>
        <p>
            A portion of all proceeds will be donated to the Community Transitional School, an amazing school that supports children experiencing housing insecurity whether they are living in motels, shelters or elsewhere.
            They provide transportation to and from the school, two hot meals a day, clothing and dental care for all students who attend the school and more.
            As importantly, they provide a warm and supportive learning environment for the children facing these challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Approximately 90% of their funding comes from donors like you and me.
            Please visit their website to
            <a href="https://www.transitionalschool.org/our-programs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">learn more about their programs</a>
