    <h1>Course Introduction: Bill Nelson 62'</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            When I was a student at Reed, I lived a reclusive life, mainly in the chemistry building. Folk
            dancing changed all that, and it has continued to be integral to my life, allowing me to cultivate friends
            from
            all around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Folk dancing, first and foremost, is about the joy of moving to music, combined with the celebration of
            community. The dances are usually done in a line or circle, giving the novice dancer the support of fellow
            dancers on either side. Historically, folk dancing, as I know it, began with the Greek hora about 3,000
            years ago (as described by Homer).
        </p>
        <p>
            The class introduces students to some of the multitude of ethnic dances that have evolved from the classical
            Greek Hora during the last 3,000 years. The Jewish dance, Hava Nagila, is a famous example of a folk dance
            that evolved from the Greek Hora!
        </p>
        <p>
            Students who take the class receive all the wonderful music played in the class! And, soon, will receive
            videos of all our dances as well!

        <h2>Marching Step Folk Dances</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Marching step</b> folk dances are done in a right, left, right, left regular rhythm. In the Greek
            tradition they begin with the right foot and compose 8 count patterns by combining two 4 count right,
            left, right, left steps.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The music Ve David is a wonderful example of a <b>marching step</b> regular rhythm done in two 4 count
                steps combining to make 8 count patterns! This first version involves a 4 count step marching forward
                and a 4 count step marching backward creating the first 8 count pattern. Then a <b>crossing over</b> 4
                count step moving left, beginning with the right foot crossing the left, moving in a right, left, right,
                left marching rhythm. That 4 count step is repeated to create our second 8 count pattern. The third 8
                count pattern is composed of two 4 count <b>turning steps</b> with the right foot going around the left
                foot while the left remains in place! These three 8 count patterns are repeated by going forward 4
                counts and backward 4 counts then two 4 count <b>crossing steps</b> moving right this time: right, left
                in front, right, left in front and two 4 count <b>turning steps</b> going around the right foot with the
                left. in front; 8 counts. Then the whole dance repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>!
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Ve David Version 2</h3>
        <iframe allowfullscreen

                width="336"></iframe>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Version 2 is modelled after Version 1, and begins with the same 4 count <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and back. The second 8 count pattern also moves left but this time the right foot crosses both in front
                and in back of the left foot! This is universally called a <b>grapevine step</b>, and like its
                forerunners: <b>crossing steps</b> and <b>turning steps</b>, it is a 4 count step! Repeating the 4 count
                <b>grapevine step</b> creates an 8 count <b>grapevine pattern</b> moving left. The third pattern is a
                <b>crossing step</b> in place: right cross steps left, left in place, right in place, left cross steps
                right. For the second 4 counts: right in place, left in place, right cross steps left, left in place.
                This completes an 8 count <b>cross steps</b> in place pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of this dance is similar to the first: 4 count <b>marching steps</b>, forward and back,
                then two 4 count <b>grapevine steps</b> moving right: right in place, left crossing in front, right,
                left crossing behind. Then the third is an 8 count pattern of <b>crossing steps</b> in place: right in
                place, left crossing right, right in place, left in place, right crossing left, left in place, right in
                place, left crossing right. Repeat both parts <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This second version introduces the most elegantly flowing step to come from the Classical World or any
                world since, in my opinion! The <b>grapevine step</b>! The <b>Jewish grapevine</b> is particularly
                interesting in that it follows the Greek model by beginning with the right foot while maintaining the
                Jewish tradition of moving left.
            </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                This third dance to the music Ve David is
                particularly important because it emphasizes
                using two different 4 count steps to create
                an 8 count pattern! Previously, the one 4 count
                step was repeated to make an 8 count pattern.
                The two 4 count steps in the second part of
                this third version are the <b>grapevine</b> step and
                the <b>cross over step</b> combining to create the
                8 count pattern! One should recognize the
                other parts the the dance.
            </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Our fourth version, unlike its predecessors, does not introduce
                any new 4 count steps but attempts to do more than just express
                the mathematical structure of the music by arranging the 8 count
                patterns such that they also express the nonmathematical feeling
                the music conveys!
            </p>
            <p>
                To accomplish that, the first part of the dance uses a <b>marching step</b>
                moving to the right and back, then, as in the other versions: forward
                and back. the second part is an 8 count <b>cross step</b> in place: right,
                left crossing right, right in place, left in place, right crossing left,
                left in place right in place, left crossing right. The third part continues
                the <b>cross step</b>: right in place, left in place, right cross left, left in place,
                followed by a 4 count <b>turn step</b> around the left. This third part
                repeats. Then the whole dance repeats, but the fourth time you
                need to repeat the third part a second time for it to feel right!

            <p>
                This is the our first dance that is presented in its
                original pre-COVID choreography except for dancing
                separately! It begins with two 4 count <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>
                plus two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b> in place.
                Then these two 8 count patterns are repeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part involves <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and back plus 4 count <b>marching steps</b> moving right
                with 4 count <b>turning steps</b> around right foot. Then,
                these two 8 count patterns are repeated,
                and that is the dance.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Our sixth dance uses the music, Yasmin. This dance
                features the <b>grapevine step</b> in its most common form,
                moving right in contrast to the Jewish version!
            </p>
            <p>
                The first 8 count pattern is a combination of a <b>marching
                step</b> moving forward and a <b>turning step</b> 180 degrees
                around your left foot. This pattern is then repeated such
                that your new forward takes you back to where you
                began, repeat these two patterns then repeat the first
                pattern such that you end up in front. Follow this with
                two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around your left foot.
                The second part begins with an 8 count pattern that
                combines a <b>grapevine step</b> with an in place <b>grapevine</b>,
                facing forward. This pattern is repeated continuing right.
                Return left to where you began, doing an 8 count <b>cross
                steps</b>. Then do two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around
                your left foot and repeat this second part.

                Repeat the whole dance ad infinitum.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note! Patterns are 8 count, steps are 4 count.
                Any two steps can be combined to create a pattern!
                Also, any music you can tap your foot to, you can count,
                and hence, express using combinations of classical
                folk dance steps!

        <h3>Mayim</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The music for our seventh marching folk dance is Mayim,
                and like Lo Ahavti Dai, is taught as it was originally done
                with the exception of a final 8 count hopping and turning
                around your left foot.
            </p>
            <p>
                It begins with two 8 count patterns of <b>Jewish grapevine
                steps</b>, followed by two 8 count patterns of <b>marching steps</b>
                moving forward and backward, singing "mayim, mayim,
                mayim, mayim" each time you go forward! The finale is
                marching right in 4 big steps to where you began then
                hopping double time in place on your right foot for 8 counts
                followed by hopping in place double time on your left foot
                while swinging your right foot to help you turn around your
                left foot for 8 counts! This doubly fast in place <b>turn step</b> is
                appropriately called a <b>buzz step</b>!
