    <h1>Course Introduction: Bill Nelson 62'</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            When I was a student at Reed, I lived a reclusive life, mainly in the chemistry building. Folk
            dancing changed all that, and it has continued to be integral to my life, allowing me to cultivate friends
            from all around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Folk dancing, first and foremost, is about the joy of moving to music, combined with the celebration of
            community. The dances are usually done in a line or circle, giving the novice dancer the support of fellow
            dancers on either side. Historically, folk dancing, as I know it, began with the Greek hora about 3,000
            years ago (as described by Homer).
        </p>
        <p>
            The class introduces students to some of the multitude of ethnic dances that have evolved from the classical
            Greek Hora during the last 3,000 years. The Jewish dance, Hava Nagila, is a famous example of a folk dance
            that evolved from the Greek Hora!
        </p>
        <p>
            Students who take the class receive all the wonderful music played in the class! And, soon, will receive
            videos of all our dances as well!

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <b>Marching step</b> folk dances are done in a right, left, right, left regular rhythm. In the Greek
                tradition they begin with the right foot and compose 8 count patterns by combining two 4 count right,
                left, right, left steps. <i>Note that we use the <b>step</b> in bold to mean a 4 count sequence of steps</i>.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The music Ve David is a wonderful example of a <b>marching step</b> regular rhythm done in two 4 count
                steps combining to make 8 count patterns! This first version involves a 4 count <b>step</b> marching
                forward and a 4 count <b>step</b> marching backward creating the first 8 count pattern. Then a <b>crossing
                over</b> 4 count <b>step</b> moving left, beginning with the right foot crossing the left, moving in a
                right, left, right,
                left marching rhythm. That 4 count <b>step</b> is repeated to create our second 8 count pattern. The
                third 8 count pattern is composed of two 4 count <b>turning steps</b> with the right foot going around
                the left
                foot while the left remains in place! These three 8 count patterns are repeated by going forward 4
                counts and backward 4 counts then two 4 count <b>crossing steps</b> moving right this time: right, left
                in front, right, left in front and two 4 count <b>turning steps</b> going around the right foot with the
                left. in front; 8 counts. Then the whole dance repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>!
            </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Version 2 is modelled after Version 1, and begins with the same 4 count <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and back. The second 8 count pattern also moves left but this time the right foot crosses both in front
                and in back of the left foot! This is universally called a <b>grapevine step</b>, and like its
                forerunners: <b>crossing steps</b> and <b>turning steps</b>, it is a 4 count <b>step</b>! Repeating the
                4 count
                <b>grapevine step</b> creates an 8 count <b>grapevine pattern</b> moving left. The third pattern is a
                <b>crossing step</b> in place: right cross steps left, left in place, right in place, left cross steps
                right. For the second 4 counts: right in place, left in place, right cross steps left, left in place.
                This completes an 8 count <b>cross steps</b> in place pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of this dance is similar to the first: 4 count <b>marching steps</b>, forward and back,
                then two 4 count <b>grapevine steps</b> moving right: right in place, left crossing in front, right,
                left crossing behind. Then the third is an 8 count pattern of <b>crossing steps</b> in place: right in
                place, left crossing right, right in place, left in place, right crossing left, left in place, right in
                place, left crossing right. Repeat both parts <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This second version introduces the most elegantly flowing step to come from the Classical World or any
                world since, in my opinion! The <b>grapevine step</b>! The <b>Jewish grapevine step</b> is particularly
                interesting in that it follows the Greek model by beginning with the right foot while maintaining the
                Jewish tradition of moving left.
            </p>

            <p>
                This third dance to the music Ve David is
                particularly important because it emphasizes
                using two different 4 count <b>steps</b> to create
                an 8 count pattern! Previously, the one 4 count
                step was repeated to make an 8 count pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two 4 count <b>step</b>s in the second part of
                this third version are the <b>grapevine step</b> and
                the <b>cross over step</b> combining to create the
                8 count pattern! One should recognize the
                other parts the the dance.

        <h3>Ve David Version 4</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Our fourth version, unlike its predecessors, does not introduce
                any new 4 count <b>steps</b> but attempts to do more than just express
                the mathematical structure of the music by arranging the 8 count
                patterns such that they also express the non-mathematical feeling
                the music conveys!
            </p>
            <p>
                To accomplish that, the first part of the dance uses a <b>marching step</b>
                moving to the right and back, then, as in the other versions: forward
                and back. The second part is an 8 count <b>cross step</b> in place: right,
                left crossing right, right in place, left in place, right crossing left,
                left in place right in place, left crossing right. The third part continues
                the <b>cross step</b>: right in place, left in place, right cross left, left in place,
                followed by a 4 count <b>turn step</b> around the left. This third part
                repeats. Then the whole dance repeats, but the fourth time you
                need to repeat the third part a second time for it to feel right!

                separately! La Ahavti Dai begins with two 4 count <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>
                plus two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b> in place.
                Then these two 8 count patterns are repeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part involves <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and back plus 4 count <b>marching steps</b> moving right
                with 4 count <b>turning steps</b> around right foot. Then,
                these two 8 count patterns are repeated,
                and that is the dance.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Our sixth dance uses the music, Yasmin. This dance
                features the <b>grapevine step</b> in its most common form,
                moving right in contrast to the Jewish version!
            </p>
            <p>
                The first 8 count pattern is a combination of a <b>marching
                step</b> moving forward and a <b>turning step</b> 180 degrees
                around your left foot. This pattern is then repeated such
                that your new forward takes you back to where you
                began, repeat these two patterns then repeat the first
                pattern such that you end up in front. Follow this with
                two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around your left foot.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part begins with an 8 count pattern that
                combines a <b>grapevine step</b> with an in place <b>grapevine step</b>,
                facing forward. This pattern is repeated continuing right.
                Return left to where you began, doing an 8 count <b>cross
                steps</b>. Then do two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around
                your left foot and repeat this second part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat the whole dance <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note! Patterns are 8 count, <b>steps</b> are 4 count.
                Any two <b>steps</b> can be combined to create a pattern!
                Also, any music you can tap your foot to, you can count,
                and hence, express using combinations of classical
                folk dance <b>steps</b>!

            <p>
                The music for our seventh marching folk dance is Mayim,
                and like Lo Ahavti Dai, is taught as it was originally done
                with the exception of a final 8 count hopping and turning
                around your left foot. The <b>buzz step</b> is the ultimate
                folk dance step for expressing music, like Mayim, that suddenly doubles
                in tempo!
            </p>
            <p>
                Mayim begins with two 8 count patterns of 4 <b>Jewish grapevine
                steps</b>, followed by two 8 count patterns of 4 <b>marching steps</b>
                moving forward and backward, singing "mayim, mayim,
                mayim, mayim" each time you go forward! The finale is
                marching right in 4 big steps to where you began then
                hopping double time in place on your right foot for 8 counts
                followed by hopping in place double time on your left foot
                while swinging your right foot to help you turn around your
                left foot for 8 counts! This doubly fast in place <b>turn step</b> is
                appropriately called a <b>buzz step</b>!

        <h2>Kolo Step Folk Dances</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                These dances introduce a new version of the <b>cross step</b>
                called the <b>kolo step</b>, which, like the other classical folk dance
                steps, is 4 count. The right moving <b>kolo step</b> begins, in the
                Greek tradition, with the right foot: right in front, left behind,
                right in front, left behind; however, the left moving <b>kolo step</b>,
                in unGreek manner, begins with the left foot: left in front, right
                behind, left in front, right behind!

            <p>
                The music for our first Kolo dance is Ersko Kolo and its choreography,
                with the addition of <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>, is the
                original Serbian form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ersko Kolo begins moving right with two 4 count <b>kolo steps</b>, continuing
                with two 4 count <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>, then two more <b>kolo steps</b>
                followed by one <b>kolo grapevine</b> and a transition step right and hold for
                counts 2, 3, and 4. Then do the mirror image of the above moving left,
                ending holding your left for counts 2, 3, 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of the dance involves marching forward: right, left, right,
                right hold, then marching backward: left, right, left, left hold. Repeat this
                8 count pattern marching to your right then backward to where you began!
                Repeat the two 8 count patterns of the second part and that is the dance!

            <p>
                The <b>kolo step</b> inspired its own whole genre of folk dances, and I suspect
                that it also inspired Celtic tribes, migrating west through the Balkans, to
                create their own kolo version, which became Irish dancing.

            <p>
                The music for our second kolo dance is Alunelul.
                The choreography has remained the same at Reed
                since the '50s when I learned it using a 78 rpm
                record for the music.
                The 8 count patterns are all combinations of <b>kolo
                steps + hold steps + stomp-lift steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first pattern is a <b>kolo step</b> moving right: right
                in front, left behind, right in front, left behind, then
                in place step right, hold right while stomp-lifting with left twice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second 8 count pattern is like the first moving
                left! Repeat these two patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third pattern is a reduced <b>kolo step</b> moving
                right: right in front, left behind, right in front, right hold
                while stomp-lift with left, followed by a reduced <b>kolo
                step</b> moving left: left in front, right behind, left in front,
                left hold while stomp-lift with right. Repeat the third
                pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fifth variation in pattern is a further
                reduced kolo: in place step right, hold right while
                stomp-lift with the left, in place step left, hold left
                while stomp-lift with right, step right, hold right while
                stomp-lift left, hold right while stomp-lift left again,
                hold right.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sixth 8 count pattern is like the fifth
                beginning in place step, left .....
                Repeat all until you are the last dancer still standing!
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>kolo step</b> like the <b>buzz step</b> is typically a double
                time step! Not for the timid dancer.
                Sometimes, to emphasize how interchangeable
                <b>kolo and buzz steps</b> are we will do Alunelul using <b>buzz steps</b>
                with clapping instead of stomp-lifts!

            <p>
                Jewish Klezmer music presents an ideal tempo for
                the <b>kolo step</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Pattern in our third kolo dance is constructed
                with two <b>kolo steps</b> moving right. The second 8 counts
                are two: right, left, right, right hold while left foot lifts,
                4 counts moving forward, then 4 counts moving
                backward. The third pattern is two <b>Jewish grapevine
                steps</b> moving left, of course, followed by 6 in-place cross
                steps: right crossing left, left in place, right in place, left
                crossing right, right in place, left in place with a two step
                turn around left foot to complete the 8 count pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat these four 8 count patterns. You should be back
                where the dance began!
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is done marching forward 4 steps then
                in place 4 counts: left hold while pointing right foot to
                right side, left hold again, left hold while pointing right
                foot again, left foot hold. Note, these 4 counts are done
                while remaining on your left foot! The next 8 counts are
                done moving sideways, first to the right: right, left, right
                right hold, then to the left: left, right, left, left hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat this second part, only marching backward 4
                counts with the same 4 counts remaining on your left
                foot and the same 8 count Pattern moving sideways: to
                the right, then to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a glorious, exhilarating dance you will want to do
                <i>ad infinitum</i>!

            <p>
                The more contemporary Israeli music, Hora, inspires
                being expressed with a combination of <b>kolo steps</b> and
                <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It begins with a <b>kolo grapevine step</b> in place + 4 steps moving
                forward followed by a <b>kolo grapevine step</b> in place and 4 steps
                moving backward to where the dance began.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part moves to the right with a <b>kolo step</b> + a
                <b>kolo grapevine step</b>, continuing right with a <b>kolo step</b> + a reduced
                <b>kolo grapevine step</b>: right in front, left behind, right behind, right
                hold! Repeat this second part moving left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then repeat the first part twice! followed by a reduced second
                part: <b>kolo step</b> + <b>kolo grapevine step</b> continuing right with a
                reduced <b>kolo step</b>: right in front, left behind, right in front,
                right hold! Repeat this reduced second part moving left!
            </p>
            <p>
                That is the dance, but remember to do the first part twice
                after the beginning!

            <p>
                The <b>hora step</b>, like the <b>kolo step</b> and <b>grapevine step</b>,
                is in 4 counts! But, unlike them, not all of the 4 counts
                are expressed with stepping! This break from constant
                stepping 4 counts revolutionized the world of dance
                because it allowed different ethnic groups to express
                their own individuality!
            </p>

            <p>
                The original Greek <b>hora dance</b> is just one 8 count pattern,
                combining a 4 count <b>marching step</b> moving right with a
                4 count <b>hora step</b> in place facing forward: right in place,
                right hold while lifting left, left in place, left hold while lifting
                right. This pattern is then repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>, or til one
                falls off the edge of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remarkably, this earliest dance is still done today just as
                it was done 3,000 years ago!
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: because the Greek <b>hora step</b> has two non-steps,
                the Greek tradition of patterns beginning with the right
                foot is retained.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wonderful music we use for dancing the Greek Hora
                is from an old 78 rpm Greek record I found in a dingy little
                New York subway shop. I only recognized one Greek word
                on the record's label: "Syrto". But, that was all I needed to
                know! It has remained my favorite Greek Hora music ever
                since.

            <p>
                Our third example of the <b>Greek hora</b> includes the Jewish version.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance begins marching to the right 4 counts plus a 4 count <b>Greek
                hora step</b> in place facing forward. Repeat these 8 counts three more
                times then do a 4 count right <b>turn step</b> as a transition step to the
                Jewish version: facing forward step right, right hold while kicking left,
                step left, left hold while kicking right. Then move left doing a <b>Jewish
                grapevine</b> for your 4 count <b>marching step</b>. Repeat these 8 counts
                three more times ending back where you began the dance! Repeat
                all of this <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note! The 4 count transition step is needed because the Jewish
                version reverses the order of the two 4 count <b>step</b>s:
                beginning with the <b>hora step</b>, then the <b>marching grapevine step</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will use our same exquisite <b>Greek hora</b> music for this dance.

            <p>
                This Israeli version of the Greek <b>hora step</b> dance is called
                Zemer Atik. It begins marching right 4 counts. Then
                continue facing right: step right, and hold right while you clap
                twice, step left, and hold left while clapping once, completing an
                8 count Israeli version of the <b>Greek hora</b>. Repeat this
                a total of four times going around a 12-by-12 foot square,
                ending where you began.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is a second Israeli
                version of the <b>Greek hora</b> that retains the older Jewish
                tradition of reversing the order of the the two 4 count <b>step</b>s,
                doing the <b>hora step</b> first: step right towards the center of
                your square, hold right while snapping your fingers, step left,
                hold left while snapping your fingers. Then step backward 4
                counts to where you began. Repeat this second part a total
                of four times to be commensurate with the first part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then repeat both parts <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A personal note regarding this version of the <b>Greek hora</b>:
                Over the decades, I've tried to convince Israeli dancers that
                their dance, Zemer Atik, is just a variation of the <b>Greek hora</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have never been successful!

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                This second Israeli version of the <b>Greek hora</b> is also
                a variation of Zemer Atik, substituting stomp-lifts for claps!
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance begins with a two step <b>kolo</b> moving right
                followed by a 4 count <b>hora step</b> facing forward: right
                in place, right hold while stomp-lifting twice with your
                left foot, step left, left hold while stomp-lifting your right
                foot. Repeat this 6 count pattern three more times
                moving right during the two step <b>kolo</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is designed to put you back to where
                you began the dance. This is accomplished by drifting left
                while moving forward 4 steps: right step, left step, right
                step plus right hop, left step. Followed by 4 steps backward
                drifting left. After repeating this 8 count forward and
                backward while drifting left you should be in a position to
                do the dance anew.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note! A stomp-lift is not a step! You don't change the
                foot supporting your weight! However, a stomp is a
                step! Similarly, a hop or skip are not steps, but a leap,
                especially of faith, is.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                This Ukrainian version of the <b>Greek hora</b> is called Arkan.
                Like Debka Daluna, it begins with a two step <b>kolo</b> moving
                right, followed by a <b>Greek hora step</b>. This 6 count pattern
                is repeated three more times.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part entails combining <b>marching steps</b> moving
                left to return to your beginning point: For your first marching
                left pattern, do 24 counts of <b>cross steps</b> left, then repeat the
                <b>hora step</b> part, which miraculously is also 24 counts. Your
                second marching left will be 6 <b>Jewish grapevine</b> which
                just happens to also be 24 counts. Repeat the <b>hora</b> part.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third marching left is a combination of a 4 count <b>cross
                step</b> and a <b>Jewish grapevine step</b> done three times or
                24 counts. Repeat the <b>hora</b> part before your fourth variation
                of the marching left part where you combine the <b>cross step</b>
                with two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>, giving you two twelve
                count patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                You then repeat this dance while changing the <b>hora steps</b>:
                The first change is to make the left lift steps, left stomp-lift!
                The second time switch to your right lift steps, making them
                right stomp-lift. Then the third time make both lift steps,
                stomp-lift steps and the fourth time, as a finale, make the
                stomp-lift steps double-stomp-lift steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                A personal note! When I was a student at pre-COVID Reed,
                Arkan was one of the most popular dances, especially when
                we would form a circle and every other dancer, with the support
                of dancers on either side, would suspend with feet extended in
                front on the floor, and then simultaneously flip over backward,
                hopefully landing upright. After my first year of doing this dance,
                I gave up wearing a wrist watch. The watch band was too often
                a casualty of the flip!
