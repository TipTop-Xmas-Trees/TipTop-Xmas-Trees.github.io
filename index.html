        <blockquote>
            <p>
                When I was a student at Reed, I lived a reclusive life, mainly in the chemistry building. Folk dancing
                changed all that, and it has continued to be integral to my life, allowing me to cultivate friends from
                all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Folk dancing, first and foremost, is about the joy of moving to music, combined with the celebration of
                community. The dances are usually done in a line or circle, giving the novice dancer the support of
                fellow dancers on either side. Historically, folk dancing, as I know it, began with the Greek hora about
                3,000 years ago (as described by Homer).
            </p>
            <p>
                The class introduces students to some of the multitude of ethnic dances that have evolved from the
                classical Greek Hora during the last 3,000 years. The Jewish dance, Hava Nagila, is a famous example of
                a folk dance that evolved from the Greek Hora!
            </p>
            <p>
                Students who take the class receive all the wonderful music played in the class! And, soon, will receive
                videos of all our dances as well!

            <h2>Marching Step Folk Dances</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Marching step</b> folk dances are done in a R, L, R, L regular rhythm. In the Greek
                tradition they begin with the R foot and compose 8 count patterns by combining two 4 count R,
                L, R, L steps. <i>Note that we use the <b>step</b> in bold to mean a 4 count sequence of steps</i>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Ve David Version 1</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q3J02vjA5fM"></iframe>
            <p>
                The music Ve David is a wonderful example of a <b>marching step</b> regular rhythm done in two 4 count
                steps combining to make 8 count patterns! This first version involves a 4 count <b>step</b> marching
                forward and a 4 count <b>step</b> marching backward creating the first 8 count pattern. Then a
                <b>crossing over</b> 4 count <b>step</b> moving L, beginning with the R foot crossing the L, moving in a
                R, L, R,
                L marching rhythm. That 4 count <b>step</b> is repeated to create our second 8 count pattern. The
                third 8 count pattern is composed of two 4 count <b>turning steps</b> with the R foot going around
                the L
                foot while the L remains in place! These three 8 count patterns are repeated by going forward 4
                counts and backward 4 counts then two 4 count <b>crossing steps</b> moving R this time: R, L
                in front, R, L in front and two 4 count <b>turning steps</b> going around the R foot with the
                L. in front; 8 counts. Then the whole dance repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Ve David Version 2</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sm5bzWLfL0Q"></iframe>
            <p>
                Ve David version 2 is modelled after version 1, and begins with the same <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and backward.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second 8 counts move left, but this time the crossing steps are both in front and in back: R crosses
                in front of L, L moves left of R, R crosses in back of L, L moves left of R.
                This is the most elegantly flowing <b>step</b> to come out of the Classical World, or any world since,
                in my opinion!
                This <b>step</b> is generally called a <b>grapevine step</b>, but, in this special case since it begins
                with the R (Greek tradition) while moving left (Jewish tradition), we call it the Jewish
                <b>grapevine step</b>!
                Repeat this Jewish <b>grapevine step</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third pattern combines two <b>cross steps</b> in place facing forward: R crosses in front of L, L
                steps in place, R steps in place, L crosses in front of R, continuing: R in place, L in place, R
                crossing in front of L, L in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second half of the dance is similar to the first: 4 count <b>marching steps</b> forward and
                backward, then moving right with two <b>grapevine steps</b>: step right with your R, L crosses in front
                of R, R moves right of L, L crosses in back of R; repeat this 4 count <b>grapevine step</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Final 8 count pattern: two <b>cross steps</b> in place: step R, L crosses in front of R, R steps in
                place, L steps in place left of R, R crosses in front of L.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat the whole dance <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Ve David Version 3</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_0Bw9NViols"></iframe>
            <p>
                This third dance to the music Ve David is
                particularly important because it emphasizes
                using two different 4 count <b>steps</b> to create
                an 8 count pattern! Previously, the one 4 count
                step was repeated to make an 8 count pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two 4 count <b>step</b>s in the second part of
                this third version are the <b>grapevine step</b> and
                the <b>cross over step</b> combining to create the
                8 count pattern! One should recognize the
                other parts the dance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Ve David Version 4</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7HF3qUcj5gc"></iframe>
            <p>
                Our fourth version, unlike its predecessors, does not introduce
                any new 4 count <b>steps</b> but attempts to do more than just express
                the mathematical structure of the music by arranging the 8 count
                patterns such that they also express the non-mathematical feeling
                the music conveys!
            </p>
            <p>
                To accomplish that, the first part of the dance uses a <b>marching step</b>
                moving to the R and back, then, as in the other versions: forward
                and back. The second part is an 8 count <b>cross step</b> in place: R,
                L crossing R, R in place, L in place, R crossing L,
                L in place R in place, L crossing R. The third part continues
                the <b>cross step</b>: R in place, L in place, R cross L, L in place,
                followed by a 4 count <b>turn step</b> around the L. This third part
                repeats. Then the whole dance repeats, but the fourth time you
                need to repeat the third part a second time for it to feel R!
            </p>

            <h3>Lo Ahavti Dai</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1oQ7Z-CeMeo"></iframe>
            <p>
                This is our first dance that is presented in its
                original pre-COVID choreography except for dancing
                separately! La Ahavti Dai begins with two 4 count <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>
                plus two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b> in place.
                Then these two 8 count patterns are repeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part involves <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and back plus 4 count <b>marching steps</b> moving R
                with 4 count <b>turning steps</b> around R foot. Then,
                these two 8 count patterns are repeated,
                and that is the dance.
            </p>

            <h3>Yasmin</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gb0py_LWWaw"></iframe>
            <p>
                Our sixth dance uses the music, Yasmin. This dance
                features the <b>grapevine step</b> in its most common form,
                moving R in contrast to the Jewish version!
            </p>
            <p>
                The first 8 count pattern is a combination of a <b>marching step</b>
                moving forward and a <b>turning step</b> 180 degrees
                around your L foot. This pattern is then repeated such
                that your new forward takes you back to where you
                began, repeat these two patterns then repeat the first
                pattern such that you end up in front. Follow this with
                two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around your L foot.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part begins with an 8 count pattern that
                combines a <b>grapevine step</b> with an in place <b>grapevine step</b>,
                facing forward. This pattern is repeated continuing R.
                Return L to where you began, doing an 8 count <b>cross
                steps</b>. Then do two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around
                your L foot and repeat this second part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat the whole dance <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note! Patterns are 8 count, <b>steps</b> are 4 count.
                Any two <b>steps</b> can be combined to create a pattern!
                Also, any music you can tap your foot to, you can count,
                and hence, express using combinations of classical
                folk dance <b>steps</b>!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Mayim</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n3f_mOCIBlo"></iframe>
            <p>
                The music for our seventh marching folk dance is Mayim,
                and like Lo Ahavti Dai, is taught as it was originally done,
                except for a final 8 count hopping and turning
                around your L foot. The <b>buzz step</b> is the ultimate
                folk dance step for expressing music, like Mayim, that suddenly doubles
                in tempo!
            </p>
            <p>
                Mayim begins with two 8 count patterns of 4 <b>Jewish grapevine
                steps</b>, followed by two 8 count patterns of 4 <b>marching steps</b>
                moving forward and backward, singing "mayim, mayim,
                mayim, mayim" each time you go forward! The finale is
                marching R in 4 big steps to where you began then
                hopping double time in place on your R foot for 8 counts
                followed by hopping in place double time on your L foot
                while swinging your R foot to help you turn around your
                L foot for 8 counts! This doubly fast in place <b>turn step</b> is
                appropriately called a <b>buzz step</b>!

            <h2>Kolo Step Folk Dances</h2>
            <p>
                These dances introduce a new version of the <b>cross step</b>
                called the <b>kolo step</b>, which, like the other classical folk dance
                steps, is 4 count. The R moving <b>kolo step</b> begins, in the
                Greek tradition, with the R foot: R in front, L behind,
                R in front, L behind; however, the L moving <b>kolo step</b>,
                in unGreek manner, begins with the L foot: L in front, R
                behind, L in front, R behind!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Ersko Kolo</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3c0GpvDTfGk"></iframe>
            <p>
                The music for our first Kolo dance is Ersko Kolo and its choreography,
                with the addition of <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>, is the
                original Serbian form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ersko Kolo begins moving R with two 4 count <b>kolo steps</b>, continuing
                with two 4 count <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>, then two more <b>kolo steps</b>
                followed by one <b>kolo grapevine</b> and a transition step R and hold for
                counts 2, 3, and 4. Then do the mirror image of the above moving L,
                ending holding your L for counts 2, 3, 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of the dance involves marching forward: R, L, R,
                R hold, then marching backward: L, R, L, L hold. Repeat this
                8 count pattern marching to your R then backward to where you began!
                Repeat the two 8 count patterns of the second part and that is the dance!
                Repeat <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>kolo step</b> inspired its own whole genre of folk dances, and I suspect
                that it also inspired Celtic tribes, migrating west through the Balkans, to
                create their own kolo version, which became Irish dancing.
            </p>

            <h3>Alunelul</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6N6-WinRaUc"></iframe>
            <p>
                The music for our second kolo dance is Alunelul.
                The choreography has remained the same at Reed
                since the '50s when I learned it using a 78 rpm
                record for the music.
                The 8 count patterns are all combinations of
                <b>kolo steps + hold steps + stomp-lift steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first pattern is a <b>kolo step</b> moving right: R in front, L behind, R in
                front, L behind; in place step R, hold R while stomp-lifting L two counts, hold
                R.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second 8 count pattern is like the first only moving left: L in front, R
                behind, L in front, R behind; L in front, L hold while stomp-lifting R two
                counts, L hold. Repeat these two 8 count patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next 8 count pattern is a combination <b>kolo steps</b> moving right and
                left: step R in front, L behind, R in front, R hold while stomp-lifting L;
                followed by the reverse, moving left: L in front, R behind, L in front, L hold
                while stomp-lifting R.
                Repeat this 8 count pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last 8 count patterns are done <b>in place</b>; step R, R hold while
                stomp-lifting L, step L, L hold while stomp-lifting R; step R, R hold while
                stomp-lifting L two counts, R hold; followed by the reverse: step L, L hold
                while stomp-lift R, R, R hold while stomp-lift L; step L, hold L while
                stomp-lifting R twice, L hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat the dance until you are the last dancer standing!
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>kolo step</b> like the <b>buzz step</b> is typically a double
                time step! Not for the timid dancer.
                Sometimes, to emphasize how interchangeable
                <b>kolo and buzz steps</b> are we will do Alunelul using <b>buzz steps</b>
                with clapping instead of stomp-lifts!

                Jewish Klezmer music presents an ideal tempo for
                the <b>kolo step</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Pattern in our third kolo dance is constructed
                with two <b>kolo steps</b> moving R. The second 8 counts
                are two: R, L, R, R hold while L foot lifts,
                4 counts moving forward, then 4 counts moving
                backward. The third pattern is two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>
                moving L, of course, followed by 6 in-place cross
                steps: R crossing L, L in place, R in place, L
                crossing R, R in place, L in place with a two-step
                turn around L foot to complete the 8 count pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat these four 8 count patterns. You should be back
                where the dance began!
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is done marching forward 4 steps then
                in place 4 counts: L hold while pointing R foot to
                R side, L hold again, L hold while pointing R
                foot again, L foot hold. Note, these 4 counts are done
                while remaining on your L foot! The next 8 counts are
                done moving sideways, first to the R: R, L, R,
                R hold, then to the L: L, R, L, L hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat this second part, only marching backward 4
                counts with the same 4 counts remaining on your L
                foot and the same 8 count Pattern moving sideways: to
                the R, then to the L.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a glorious, exhilarating dance you will want to do
                <i>ad infinitum</i>!

            <p>
                The more contemporary Israeli music, Hora, inspires
                being expressed with a combination of <b>kolo steps</b> and
                <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It begins with a <b>kolo grapevine step</b> in place + 4 steps moving
                forward followed by a <b>kolo grapevine step</b> in place and 4 steps
                moving backward to where the dance began.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part moves to the R with a <b>kolo step</b> + a
                <b>kolo grapevine step</b>, continuing R with a <b>kolo step</b> + a reduced
                <b>kolo grapevine step</b>: R in front, L behind, R behind, R
                hold! Repeat this second part moving L.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then repeat the first part twice! followed by a reduced second
                part: <b>kolo step</b> + <b>kolo grapevine step</b> continuing R with a
                reduced <b>kolo step</b>: R in front, L behind, R in front,
                R hold! Repeat this reduced second part moving L!
            </p>
            <p>
                That is the dance, but remember to do the first part twice
                after the beginning!

            <h2>Greek Hora Step Folk Dances</h2>
            <p>
                The <b>hora step</b>, like the <b>kolo step</b> and <b>grapevine step</b>;
                is in 4 counts! But, unlike them, not all the 4 counts
                are expressed with stepping! This break from constant
                stepping 4 counts revolutionized the world of dance
                because it allowed different ethnic groups to express
                their own individuality!
            </p>
            <p>
                And it all began in ancient Greece 3,000 years ago!
            </p>

            <h3>Greek Hora Dances 1 &amp; 2</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ajD9Bwbn7mw"></iframe>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q5V-x8xBTwA"></iframe>
            <p>
                The original Greek <b>hora dance</b> is just one 8 count pattern,
                combining a 4 count <b>marching step</b> moving R with a
                4 count <b>hora step</b> in place facing forward: R in place,
                R hold while lifting L, L in place, L hold while lifting
                R. This pattern is then repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>, or til one
                falls off the edge of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remarkably, this earliest dance is still done today just as
                it was done 3,000 years ago!
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: because the Greek <b>hora step</b> has two non-steps,
                the Greek tradition of patterns beginning with the R
                foot is retained.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wonderful music we use for dancing the Greek Hora
                is from an old 78 rpm Greek record I found in a dingy little
                New York subway shop. I only recognized one Greek word
                on the record's label: "Syrto". But, that was all I needed to
                know! It has remained my favorite Greek Hora music ever
                since.

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 3: Jewish Version</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KMeVqh7I5RM"></iframe>
            <p>
                Our third example of the <b>Greek hora</b> includes the Jewish version.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance begins marching to the R 4 counts plus a 4 count <b>Greek hora step</b>
                in place facing forward. Repeat these 8 counts three more
                times, then do a 4 count R <b>turn step</b> as a transition step to the
                Jewish version: facing forward, step R in place; R hold while kicking L,
                step L, L hold while kicking R. Then move L doing a
                <b>Jewish grapevine</b> for your 4 count <b>marching step</b>. Repeat these 8 counts
                three more times ending back where you began the dance! Repeat
                all of this <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note! The 4 count transition step is needed because the Jewish
                version reverses the order of the two 4 count <b>step</b>s:
                beginning with the <b>hora step</b>, then the <b>marching grapevine step</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will use our same exquisite <b>Greek hora</b> music for this dance.
            </p>

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 4: Zemer Atik</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KMeVqh7I5RM"></iframe>
            <p>
                This Israeli version of the Greek <b>hora step</b> dance is called
                Zemer Atik. It begins marching R 4 counts. Then
                continue facing R: step R, and hold R while you clap
                twice, step L, and hold L while clapping once, completing an
                8 count Israeli version of the <b>Greek hora</b>. Repeat this
                a total of four times going around a 12-by-12 foot square,
                ending where you began.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is a second Israeli
                version of the <b>Greek hora</b> that retains the older Jewish
                tradition of reversing the order of the two 4 count <b>step</b>s,
                doing the <b>hora step</b> first: step R towards the center of
                your square, hold R while snapping your fingers, step L,
                hold L while snapping your fingers. Then step backward 4
                counts to where you began. Repeat this second part a total
                of four times to be commensurate with the first part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then repeat both parts <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A personal note regarding this version of the <b>Greek hora</b>:
                Over the decades, I've tried to convince Israeli dancers that
                their dance, Zemer Atik, is just a variation of the <b>Greek hora</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have never been successful!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 5: Debka Daluna</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hHLBIUTt6mQ"></iframe>
            <p>
                This second Israeli version of the <b>Greek hora</b> is also
                a variation of Zemer Atik, substituting stomp-lifts for claps!
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance begins with a two step <b>kolo</b> moving R
                followed by a 4 count <b>hora step</b> facing forward: R
                in place, R hold while stomp-lifting twice with your
                L foot, step L, L hold while stomp-lifting your R
                foot. Repeat this 6 count pattern three more times
                moving R during the two step <b>kolo</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is designed to put you back to where
                you began the dance. This is accomplished by drifting L
                while moving forward 4 steps: R step, L step, R
                step plus R hop, L step. Followed by 4 steps backward
                drifting L. After repeating this 8 count forward and
                backward while drifting L you should be in a position to
                do the dance anew.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note! A stomp-lift is not a step! You don't change the
                foot supporting your weight! However, a stomp is a
                step! Similarly, a hop or skip are not steps, but a leap,
                especially of faith, is.
            </p>

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 6: Arkan</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pz8QNL8wNP8"></iframe>
            <p>
                This Ukrainian version of the <b>Greek hora</b> is called Arkan.
                Like Debka Daluna, it begins with a two step <b>kolo</b> moving
                R, followed by a <b>Greek hora step</b>. This 6 count pattern
                is repeated three more times.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part entails combining <b>marching steps</b> moving
                L to return to your beginning point: For your first marching
                L pattern, do 24 counts of <b>cross steps</b> L, then repeat the
                <b>hora step</b> part, which miraculously is also 24 counts. Your
                second marching L will be 6 <b>Jewish grapevine</b> which
                just happens to also be 24 counts. Repeat the <b>hora</b> part.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third marching L is a combination of a 4 count <b>cross step</b>
                and a <b>Jewish grapevine step</b> done three times or
                24 counts. Repeat the <b>hora</b> part before your fourth variation
                of the marching L part where you combine the <b>cross step</b>
                with two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>, giving you two twelve
                count patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                You then repeat this dance while changing the <b>hora steps</b>:
                The first change is to make the L lift steps, L stomp-lift!
                The second time switch to your R lift steps, making them
                R stomp-lift. Then the third time make both lift steps,
                stomp-lift steps and the fourth time, as a finale, make the
                stomp-lift steps double-stomp-lift steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                A personal note! When I was a student at pre-COVID Reed,
                Arkan was one of the most popular dances, especially when
                we would form a circle and every other dancer, with the support
                of dancers on either side, would suspend with feet extended in
                front on the floor, and then simultaneously flip over backward,
                hopefully landing upright. After my first year of doing this dance,
                I gave up wearing a wristwatch. The watch band was too often
                a casualty of the flip!
            </p>

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 7: Hava Nagila</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/33J7PidG1Sk"></iframe>
            <p>
                This Jewish version of the Greek Hora is probably the most
                familiar of all the different ethnic versions!
            </p>
            <p>
                Hava Nagila begins with four 8 count combinations of a <b>Greek hora step</b>
                with a <b>Jewish grapevine step</b>, followed by 8 counts
                of two <b>Greek hora steps</b> and 8 counts of a <b>buzz step</b> around
                your R foot. These last two 8 count patterns are repeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, facing forward, moving backward: step R while clapping,
                hold R, step L while clapping, hold L followed by four steps
                backward while clapping with each step. Continue facing forward
                hopping in place on your R foot 8 counts, then hop on your L
                foot 8 counts. Repeat these two 8 counts of hopping in place,
                followed by turning moving R: R, L, R, R hold and
                clap plus turning moving L: L, R, L, L hold and clap.
                And, that is our version of Hava Nagila.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: The part facing forward, moving backward is another version
                of the Greek Hora in the Jewish form of reversing the order of
                <b>marching step</b> and <b>hora step</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, if you listen carefully, you can hear the needle dropping onto
                the 78 Michael Herman Folk-dancer recording of our Hava Nagila
                music.

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 8: Hora Agadati</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2cQ6m5pUQAY"></iframe>
            <p>
                This is another Israeli version of the Greek Hora.
                It was originally choreographed as a line dance,
                but for pandemic times, it can be done along the
                sides of a 12-foot square. Beginning at the bottom
                L corner, run R 4 steps, then bounce in place
                4 counts. Repeat this pattern along each side of
                the square, returning to the bottom L corner.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is done in place facing forward
                with two <b>hora steps</b>: step R, R hold while
                touching L heel in front, step L, hold L while
                touching your R toe to your R side. Repeat
                this <b>hora step</b>. For the next 8 count pattern: in
                place, bounce L, bounce R, bounce L, stomp
                R in front; then: step L in place, hold L, hold
                L while clapping three times with the music.
                Repeat this 8 count pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note! Hora Agadati has the same mathematical
                structure as Hava Nagila: They each are constructed
                with two parts having four 8 count patterns.

            <h3>Evolution of Greek Hora</h3>
            <p>
                The Greek Hora soon spread throughout the Classical World!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my opinion, it was the R hold and L hold part of
                the <b>Greek hora step</b> that made it so dramatically popular, because
                the two holds encouraged the various ethnic peoples to express
                their individuality and embrace the dance as their own!
            </p>
            <p>
                The result was: the form of the <b>Greek hora step</b> changed with
                each ethnic adoption of the dance, making the <b>Greek hora step</b>
                no longer definable by its form. The Greek Hora had evolved
                beyond form to rhythm and the future of folk dancing would become
                more and more about rhythm instead of form.
            </p>
            <p>
                To emphasize the difference between form and rhythm we will
                give our <b>marching step</b> forms a Greek Hora rhythm!

            <p>
                Using our basic 8 count music, Ve David: march facing forward:
                R, L, R, L, then backward: R, hold R, L, hold L. For the second
                8 counts <b>cross step</b> left: R crossing L, L stepping left, R crossing L,
                L stepping left, then continuing: R crossing L, R hold, L stepping left,
                L hold. The third 8 counts are: R turning around L, L in place, R
                around L, L in place, then R turning around L, R hold, L in place, L hold. Repeat the forward and
                backward 8 counts and the <b>cross step</b>
                8 counts, only moving R this time, Also 8 counts around the R, all in Greek Hora rhythm!
            </p>
            <p>
                Then repeat the first forward and backward part, and the crossing
                steps part only moving to your R this time, and the turning steps,
                moving around your R this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                After which, you can start over: substituting <b>grapevine marching steps</b>
                for the <b>cross steps</b> and <b>cross steps</b> in place for the
                <b>turn steps</b>. And, for the particularly adventurist dancers, you can
                create your own combinations of <b>marching steps</b> to do as a
                Greek Hora rhythm!

            <h2>Three-step Hora Step Folk Dances</h2>
            <p>
                The Greek Hora was not only transformed in form as it
                spread throughout the ancient world creating a multitude
                of ethnic versions, its rhythm also changed!

            <h3>Iste Hendek</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ioc7Me31Do"></iframe>
            <p>
                The earliest example of this is a 3-step Hora Step as
                represented by the Turkish dance, Iste Hendek which
                expresses a 1, 2, 3, hold rhythm rather than the <b>Greek hora step's:</b>
                1, hold, 3, hold rhythm! Iste Hendek compensates
                for having only one hold by repeating its 3 step <b>hora step</b>
                so that its 8 count pattern will contain two holds just like
                the 8 count Greek Hora! Also, like the Greek Hora, Iste
                Hendek begins with the R foot and ends its 8 count pattern
                on its L foot, ready to repeat ad infinitum, with appropriate
                Turkish changes in form, of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dance begins facing forward: step forward R, step
                forward L, forward R, hold R while lifting L, followed by:
                stepping backward L, backward R, backward L, hold L
                twisting L and R while remaining on your L. I refer
                to this as a Turkish twist. Repeat this 8 count pattern three
                more times. The second pattern builds on the first by substituting:
                double stomp forward R instead of just forward R, as the third count!
                The fourth count remains: R hold while lifting L.
                This second pattern like the first is repeated 3 more times.
                The third pattern changes the form of the first by substituting skip
                backward for the lift. Remember, a skip, like a lift, is not
                a step. We refer to this skip backward as a Turkish chug.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third 8 counts only repeats once. The fourth (and last)
                pattern embellishes the third by adding a double stomp
                before the Turkish chug, and replaces the Turkish twist
                with a more exuberant stomp twist! This pattern is repeated
                once.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance does not repeat exactly with the music we use:
                the first pattern repeats only once, but the second pattern
                still repeats 3 times, while the third pattern repeats once,
                the fourth pattern repeats until the needle falls off our 45
                recording!

                Like the <b>Greek hora step, </b>the 3 step <b>hora step </b>evolved into
                multifarious forms but its rhythm remained constant! To

                of <b>marching steps </b>a 3 step <b>hora step</b> rhythm, just as we did

                This exquisite Bulgarian music expresses the 3-step Hora rhythm.
                We will dance along the four sides of a square. Beginning in the
                lower left corner move right two 3 step <b>hora steps</b>. Repeat this
                8 count pattern as you go around the square back to where you
                began. The second part combines a <b>Greek hora step</b> and
                a 3 step <b>hora step</b> moving right, then moving left back to the
                beginning Repeat this second part. Then repeat your circuit
                around the square adding three 8 count 3 step <b>hora steps</b> turning
                around your R foot. Repeat the second part adding four 8 count <b>buzz steps</b>:
                first around R, then around L, around R, around L. Repeat going around the
                square and second part. Then a final circuit adding just one 8 count
                turning around your R, plus a final second part.
                And that is final! Unless you want to repeat the dance!

            <p>
                This enchanting Israeli music is all 3 step <b>hora rhythm</b> music!

                It begins facing forward moving sideways stepping R, step L next to R,
                step R, hold R. Then do the same moving L. Repeat this 8 count pattern.
                The second part is facing and moving forward keeping R in front: R, L, R,
                R hold; then backward keeping L in back: L, R, L, L hold. Repeat this 8
                count pattern. Repeat the first part but only one 8 count pattern of the
                second part.

                The third 3 step <b>hora rhythm</b> is still facing forward: step
                forward to the R, forward L, cross L with R, hold R. Then forward L,
                forward R, cross R with L, L hold. Repeat this 8 count pattern. Still
                facing forward moving backward keeping the R ahead: R, L, R, hold R,
                then continue L ahead: L, R, L, hold L. Repeat this 8 count, and you
                should be back where you began!

                You then start over adding two more
                8 count patterns to the seven you did the first time. And, then repeat
                the two 8 count patterns going forward and backward; concluding the
                dance with the side to side part til the music ends.

            <p>
                This 3 step <b>hora rhythm</b> is expressed much like it is to the
                music, Enchant. You begin facing and moving forward: R, L, R
                crossing L, R hold; continue: L, R, L crossing R, L hold; then:
                R, L, R crossing L, quick two-step turn around L. Then immediately:
                step L, R, L crossing R, L hold; R, L, R crossing L, R hold;
                L, R, L crossing R, slow four-step turn around R to transition into
                the second part: Remain facing forward: step in front with R,
                in place L, R in place, R hold; then: stepping back: L, R, L, L hold.
                Repeat this 8 count pattern three more times, returning to your
                original spot. See video to learn the arm movements that complement
                this second part! In general, hand/arm movements mirror foot/leg
                movements: in this dance, when your R foot steps in front, your
                hands also move forward in front of your face, and as you slowly
                move backward, your hands/arms slowly descend.

            <p>
                This example of the 3 step <b>hora</b> is done to the Russian music, Troika. As the name implies, this
                dance was originally intended to be done by groups of 3 dancers; which we will do when we are not having
                a pandemic. Meanwhile, we can still enjoy dancing to this voluptuous music by creating an individualized
                version.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our version begins facing forward stepping moving forward 8 counts in Russian style; then moving
                backward 8 counts to where you began. The next two 8 counts are combinations of 3 step <b>hora steps</b>
                in place facing forward: R stomping in front of L while clapping, L in place, R in place, R hold; L
                stomping in front of R while clapping, R in place, L in place, L hold. Repeat these two 3 step
                <b>hora step</b> rhythms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second half of the dance involves <b>grapevine steps</b> moving left: three Jewish
                <b>grapevine steps</b>, then step R, hop on your R three times in place; with your L free move right
                three Jewish
                <b>grapevine steps</b>, step L, hop on L three times in place. This completes four 8 counts, making the
                second half commensurate with the first half.

            <p>
                This Russian dance features two examples of moving 3-step Hora rhythms, which are quite different
                from the in-place 3 step Hora <b>steps</b> previously described for Troika!
            </p>
            <p>
                Korobushka begins facing forward, moving forward: R, L, R, R hop while lifting L; then moving backward:
                L, R, L, L hop while lifting R: moving forward again: R, L, R, L; then L hop while R crosses in front of
                L, L hop again while R moves back in place with your weight remaining on L, R moves to meet L clicking
                the heels of your Russian boots, L hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of this dance begins with a moving right 3 step <b>hora</b> while turning around your R:
                R, L, R, R hold while clapping; then do the same only moving to your left: L, R, L, L hold while
                clapping; facing forward in place R, R hold while snapping fingers, L, L hold while snapping fingers,
                followed by 4 count <b>marching step</b> moving backward clapping: you're doing an 8 count Jewish Greek
                Hora moving backward rather than moving left!
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                The dance begins moving right with a <b>kolo step</b> followed by an
                <b>in place kolo step</b>. This 8 count pattern repeats three more times.
            </p>
            Facing, moving forward do a 2 step <b>hora rhythm</b>: R, L, L hold while
            stomp lifting R in place, L hold while stomp lifting R in place again.
            Reverse this moving backwards still facing forward. Repeat this 8
            count pattern.
            <p>
                Moving this time to your left crossing your left with a
                stomping R, L a total of 16 counts, putting you back where you began
                the dance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is done facing forward in place: step behind with your R, L in
                place, L hold while R stomp holds in front with your weight remaining on your L,
                L hold.
                Repeat this 2 step <b>hora step</b> three more times measuring 16 counts!
            </p>
            <p>
                Continue in place turning around your L: stomp chugging with both feet 8 counts
                with your weight remaining on your L. Then do the reverse, going around
                backward 8 counts with your weight still remaining on your L.
                Totaling 16 counts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Facing forward in place: step R while extending your L forward, L back in place
                while extending your R forward: these 2 steps are called scissor steps.
                The next two counts are the non-step part of the 2 step <b>hora step</b>: L hold
                while stomp lifting R, L hold while stomp lifting R.
                Repeat these 4 counts three more times of course, giving 16 counts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The finale is moving right and left switching to the more facilitating
                <b>step</b> for doing so, the 3 step <b>hora</b>!
                And yes, it will be four 3 step <b>hora steps</b>, I wonder how many counts that
                might be?

                1 step <b>hora rhythms</b> usually involve hopping in place three counts during

            <p>

                The first part of the dance is done facing forward, moving forward with a combination of a <b>marching
                step + Jewish grapevine step in place</b>, repeat this 8 count pattern, then still facing forward move
                backward: R, L, a total of 8 counts.
                You should be back to where you began!
                Finish this first part with two 3 step <b>hora rhythms in place</b> facing forward: R in place, L
                crossing in front of R, R in place, R hold; L, R crossing in front of L, L in place, L hold.
                Repeat this first part.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part expresses a unique form of the 1 step <b>hora</b>: it begins, as usual, stepping R
                facing right, then while remaining on your R have your L touch the floor, brush the floor, and lift
                pointing right, to complete the <b>step</b>.
                The second four counts move right: L, R, L, L hold while lifting your R facing right. Repeat this 8
                count pattern moving right.
                Move left with two <b>grapevine-type steps</b> beginning with R behind L ending back where you began.
                Then do two 3 step <b>hora rhythms</b> in place: R, L cross in front of R, R in place, R hold; L in
                place, R cross in front of L, L in place, L hold.
                Finish with <b>turning step in place</b> around your L 8 counts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>grapevine-type step</b> in this dance is very unusual: you are facing
                right when you begin: stepping R behind L moving left, L step left while turning
                to face forward, R stepping in front of L still moving left, L step left.
                A <b>grapevine step</b> moving left beginning with the R, is virtually always a
                <b>Jewish grapevine!</b>
                I cannot think of another exception; therefore, it must be unique!

            <h2>Greek Syrto Hora Step Dances</h2>
            <p>
                For me, the <b>Greek syrto hora</b> is the final, ultimate evolution of the <b>Greek hora</b>,
                and the most exquisite <b>step/rhythm</b> in all of dance. Although the <b>cha cha
                step/rhythm</b> has arguably become the most popular <b>step/rhythm</b> around the
                world, the <b>Greek syrto hora</b> remained uniquely Greek until the Reed Folk
                Dancing Class.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b> is: R, R hold, L, R, then L, L hold, R, L repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>Greek syrto hora</b> has only been done to Greek music, it never spread everywhere like its
                predecessor, the <b>Greek hora</b>. And, never evolved into multifarious ethnic versions with
                multifarious
                ethnic music until the Reed Folk Dance Class!

            <h3>Greek Syrto Hora as a Rhythm</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ExllZNA44aU"></iframe>
            <p>
                We will use our standard 8 count model music,
                Ve David,
                to express our <b>marching steps</b> with <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>:
                facing forward,
                moving forward:
                step R;
                R hold;
                L;
                R;
                continuing forward:
                L;
                L hold;
                R;
                L;
                facing forward moving backwards:
                R;
                R hold;
                L;
                R;
                continuing backwards:
                L;
                L hold;
                R;
                L;
                You should be back where you began!
                Move left 8 counts crossing in front with R;
                Then move around your L 8 more counts,
                always with a <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>.
                Repeat the two 8 counts moving forward and backward;
                followed by 8 counts of moving right with <b>cross steps</b> and around your R 8 counts with <b>turn
                steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will make the next part linear by substituting cross steps in place
                for the forward and backward patterns: in place cross R in front of L,
                R hold, L in place, R in place; L in front of R, L hold, R in place,
                L in place; Then: moving cross steps left 8 counts as before and turning
                around your left as in the first part, and repeat the 8 counts of cross steps in
                place, followed by 8 counts of moving cross step right and 8 counts of
                turn steps around your R. Repeat this linear movement left and right plus
                a third left. All in Greek syrto rhythm!
            </p>
            <p>
                The last part is the same linear description except the right moving cross
                step begins with a right moving kolo grapevine step.
            </p>
            <p>

                You should be back where you began this dance eager to repeat it countless times!
                expressing the unique <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b> all the while!
            </p>

            <p>
                This is Israeli music that emphasizes the <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>. We will
                use the original form for expressing the <b>Greek syrto steps</b>: facing forward
                step R; R hold while lifting L behind R; step L behind R; moving and facing
                right while stepping R; (this 4 count <b>step</b> is the closest the Greeks ever came
                to creating a <b>grapevine step</b>) continue moving right, crossing R, step L;
                L hold; moving right, facing right, step R; moving right step L while facing
                forward. This completes the first 8 count pattern.
                The second 8 counts are done <b>in place facing forward</b>: step R; R hold
                while lifting L; L step in front; R in place; L in place; L hold while lifting R;
                R steps in front; L in front; and that completes the second 8 count pattern!
            </p>
            <p>
                The second half of the dance is a repeat of these two 8 count patterns,
                only moving left to end up where we began:
                facing forward, step R;
                R hold while lifting L behind R;
                step L behind R;
                moving and facing left while stepping R;
                continue moving and facing left, step L;
                L hold;
                step R;
                step L while facing forward.
                The second 8 counts <b>in place facing forward</b> are exactly as described for the first half.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, Greek dances did not move to the left. But , when Greeks
                immigrated to America, to start a new life, they created a new version
                of their <b>syrto hora</b> called the Greek Misirlou, and it moves left and right
                as we will soon see!

            <p>
                This second <b>Greek syrto</b> music is also not Greek;
                it is not even from the greater world of Alexander!
                It is rather American Pop/Country music!
                But, it is the clearest expression of <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b> I have ever heard!
                And, more importantly, it incites one to go outside the original form of the very linear <b>Greek
                syrto</b>,
                which we will refer to as <b>standard linear syrto form</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance begins with the <b>standard linear syrto form</b>:
                moving right two 8 count patterns of <b>syrto</b>;
                then left two 8 counts;
                then repeat this right and left <b>linear syrto</b> with its last 2 counts expressed as a 2 step
                180-degree turn around your L:
                R in front, L turn in place 180 degrees;
                Facing and moving south of the <b>syrto line</b> in <b>syrto rhythm:</b> step R, R hold, L, R;
                L, L hold, R, L while turning in place 180 degrees;
                now, facing forward: R in place, R hold, L steps behind R, R steps forward toward the right end of the
                <b>standard syrto line</b>;
                continue to syrto forward: L, L hold, R, L;
                You should be in place to go back to <b>standard form</b>:
                R in place, R hold, L in front, R in place; L in place, L hold, R in front, L in place;
                continue <b>standard syrto form </b>moving left to where we began the dance.
                Repeat this entire first part excluding:
                continue <b>standard syrto form</b> moving left to where we began the dance.
                Instead, R in place facing forward,
                R hold, L behind R, R facing left, moving left;
                L moving left,
                L hold with transition to 3-step hora rhythm moving left:
                R, L, R, R hold;
                L, R, L, L hold;
                R, L, R, R hold;
                turn 180 degrees around R:
                step L facing forward, R in place, L crossing R moving right, facing right, L hold;
                moving right:
                R, L, R, R hold;
                L, R, L, L hold;
                turn 180 degrees around L:
                step R facing forward, L in place, R crossing L facing left, R hold;
                Repeat these 3 step <b>horas</b> moving left and moving right;
                then move left for the third time:
                L, R, L, L hold;
                R, L, R, R hold;
                turn 90 degrees around R:
                step L in place facing forward,
                R in place facing forward, L cross R, L hold facing forward;
                Repeat the <b>non-standard syrto form</b> with the 180 degree turns for the third time;
                followed by <b>standard linear syrto</b> moving left, then right, left again, right again, left, then
                right, a final left before a final <b>non-standard syrto</b> with the 180 degree turns.
                Then end the dance as it began: with <b>standard linear syrto form</b>. This dance is a wonderful
                example of the freedom to move out of the box or in this case, off the line, that the <b>syrto
                rhythm</b> inspires!

            <h3>Karagouna</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X6ZoktN7h3g"></iframe>
            <p>
                Karagouna is unmistakably Greek in music and dance, featuring
                the <b>Greek syrto</b> along with 1 and 3 step <b>horas</b>. It begins facing
                forward, walking forward: stepping R, L, R, R hold while touching
                left with L; then: L in place, L hold while touching right three times
                with your R. Repeat this 8 count pattern walking backward while
                still facing forward. You should be where you began! Repeat this
                first part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second part: moving right doing a <b>kolo step</b> double stamping with
                your R as you move right 8 counts. You should be on your L:
                The next 8 counts are done <b>in place</b>: L hold while you touch right
                side with R, L hold while touching again with R, double hop with L
                while you turn left, step R in front of L. Reverse these 4 counts:
                Starting with R hold while you touch left with L, R hold while touching
                again with L, double hop with R while turning left, step L in front
                of R. This completes two 8 count patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third part, like the second, consists of two 8 count patterns: This
                time, as a finale for the dance, the two patterns are appropriately two
                <b>Greek syrto horas</b> moving left back to where you can eagerly repeat
                all three parts!
            </p>

            <h3>Miserlou</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cNvT3Z7wY6o"></iframe>
            <p>
                This next dance is a different version of the <b>Greek syrto</b>, an American
                version! Greek immigrants came here to begin a new life: new language,
                new traditions and a new <b>form</b> for their cherished <b>Greek syrto</b> which is
                called Miserlou. It is the same unique <b>syrto rhythm</b>; only the <b>form</b> was
                changed: It begins facing forward in place: R, R hold while lifting L,
                step
                behind R with L, R in place while facing left; step left with your L, L
                hold
                while your R boldly crosses in front of your L moving left, R, L moving
                left;
                R, R hold facing left lift L, step backward with L moving back toward where
                you began, continue backward with R; and L, L hold while you face
                forward, you should be where you started, step R in place, L in place.
                Repeat these two 8 count patterns ad infinitum to fully enjoy this unique
                <b>form</b> of the <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                Miserlou appears to be a completely new creation; and it is in <b>form</b>,
                but <b>form</b> is deceptive and readily changeable in dance and everything
                else. What is constant about Miserlou is its <b>rhythm</b>; and that is the
                inimitable <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>!
