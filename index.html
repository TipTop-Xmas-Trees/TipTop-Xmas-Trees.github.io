        <blockquote>
            <p>
                When I was a student at Reed, I lived a reclusive life, mainly in the chemistry building. Folk dancing
                changed all that, and it has continued to be integral to my life, allowing me to cultivate friends from
                all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Folk dancing, first and foremost, is about the joy of moving to music, combined with the celebration of
                community. The dances are usually done in a line or circle, giving the novice dancer the support of
                fellow dancers on either side. Historically, folk dancing, as I know it, began with the Greek hora about
                3,000 years ago (as described by Homer).
            </p>
            <p>
                The class introduces students to some of the multitude of ethnic dances that have evolved from the
                classical Greek Hora during the last 3,000 years. The Jewish dance, Hava Nagila, is a famous example of
                a folk dance that evolved from the Greek Hora!
            </p>
            <p>
                This website provides access to all the wonderful music played in the class!
                And, soon, videos of all our dances as well!

        <h2>Reed Folk Dancing Lexicon</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Folk Dance Music</b> is any music that has a uniform beat which allows
            one to count the beats with whole numbers. Pragmatically, if you can march to the music's beats, then it is Folk Dance-able Music.   
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The Greeks</b> over 3,000 years ago created the mathematical structure
            for dance and its music by dividing counting into 4 count parts. These 4 count parts will be referred to as
            <b>rhythms</b>! 
        <p>
            <b>rhythms</b> are a 4 count measure of music, and they differ in how many of the 4 counts are <i>steps</i> versus <i>nonsteps</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>step</i> has a very definitive meaning in Folk Dance. A <i>step</i> occurs only when one changes their weight from one foot to the other foot.
            Examples of Folk Dance <i>steps</i> are: <i>marching steps, side steps, cross steps, kolo steps, grapevine steps, balancing steps,</i> 
            and <i>balance/cross steps</i>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>nonstep</i> can express its count with the weighted foot skipping or hopping, so that one's weight remains on the same foot.
            A second way to express a <i>nonstep</i> is to use the free foot to express the count, with the weighted foot still planted in place.
            The free foot can be used to touch the floor with a toe or heel; or slap and stomp the floor with the flat of the free foot, as long
            as one does <u>not</u> shift their weight. The Greeks, traditionally, express the count by lifting the free foot! The height of the
            free foot can indicate which village the dancer comes from. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
  
            <b>The Greeks Construct the First Dance</b> in recorded history, called the <b>Greek Hora Dance</b>. It combines
            4 counts <i>moving right</i> with 4 counts <i>facing forward, standing in place</i>. These two 4 counts make an 8 count <b>pattern</b>
            that repeats ad infinitum to create the <b>Greek Hora Dance</b>!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>patterns</b> based on the <b>Greek Hora Model</b> are 8 counts in length, <u>beginning
            with R</u> and ending with L. In general, any length of music with an even number of <i>steps</i> can repeat becoming a <b>pattern</b>.
            
        </p>    
        <p>
            <b>The Form of the Greek Hora Dance</b> is <i>linear</i> beginning with a <b>marching rhythm</b> (R, L, R, L) stepping with R, 
            <i>facing right, moving right</i> along a straight line called the <i>baseline</i> for 4 <i>steps</i>. The second 4 counts
            present a different rhythm called the <b>Greek hora rhythm</b> (R, N, L, N). It begins stepping on the <i>baseline</i> with R while
            <i>facing forward</i>, lifting L in front of <i>baseline</i>, still facing forward, step on <i>baseline</i> with L, followed by lifting R
            in front of <i>baseline</i>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            R, L, and N are shorthand for: stepping on right foot, stepping on left foot, and a <i>nonstep</i>.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>baseline</i> is the physical frame of reference for the construction of folk
            dances. <i>Facing forward</i>, standing <i>in place</i>, it is defined as the line
            between your feet extending to your right!
        </p>
      
        <p>
            <marching rhythms> are a measure of 4 counts where each count is a <i>step</i> (R, L, R, L). <i>Grapevine steps</i> and <i>balance/cross 
                steps</i> are examples of <b>marching rhythms</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Greek hora rhythms</b> express only the first and third counts as steps, leaving the second and fourth counts 
            as nonsteps. The Greek hora rhythm, traditionally and today in Greece, is always done on the <i>baseline, facing forward, in place</i>
            with the 2 <i>nonsteps</i> being lifts. Outside Greece, the Greek hora rhythm can take on <b>forms</b> of moving instead of in place, and using
            different <i>nonsteps</i> other than the Greek tradition of a lift.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>form</b> of a dance refers to what you <u>see</u>, in contrast to <b>rhythm</b>, which is what you <u>hear</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Rhythm Versus Form in Dance</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a finite number of rhythms, being limited by the number of combinations of <i>steps</i> and <i>nonsteps</i> which is 2^4
            which equals <u>16</u>. But, the much greater limiting factor is <u>tradition</u>‚⁄ﬁ⁄particularly Greek tradition‚⁄ﬁ⁄leaving only 3 
            main rhythms: <b>marching rhythms</b> (R, L, R, L); <b>Greek hora rhythms</b> (R, N, L, N); and <b>3 step hora rhythms</b> (R, L, R, N).
            In contrast to rhythms, the variation of forms exhibited is limited only by the imagination of the dancer. But like rhythms, form
            has been very limited by tradition.
        </p>

        <p> 
            <i>Half step</i> occurs when counting include half counts: 1, 1&amp;, 2, 2&amp;, 3, 3&amp;, 4, 4&amp;
            or more simply: 1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;.
            Hence, a <b>rhythm</b> could include as many as 4 <i>half steps</i> or even 5 if you began with &amp;!
            Also note: Just as counts can be expressed as <i>steps</i> or <i>nonsteps</i> so can <i>half steps</i> which
            are half counts!
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Forms of Marching Rhythms</b> 
        </p>
        <p>
            The main forms of a marching rhythm are cross step, serbian kolo step, grapevine step, and turning step.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Cross Step</b> as <b>marching rhythm</b>:
            <i>step</i> R on <i>baseline</i>; cross in front of R with L; move R to the right of L on <i>baseline</i>;
            cross in front of R with L foot.
            This completes a 4 count <b>cross step rhythm</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Serbian kolo step</b> as <b>marching rhythm</b>: <i>step</i> R on <i>baseline</i>; move L behind
            R; R <i>steps</i> right of L on <i>baseline</i>; move L behind R.
            This completes a 4 count <b>Serbian kolo marching rhythm</b>.
            <b>Note</b>: L does not <u>cross</u> behind R; progress <i>moving</i> right is only done by R!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Grapevine step</b> as <b>marching rhythm</b>: <i>step</i> R on <i>baseline</i>; cross in
            front of R with L; move R pass L, but on the <i>baseline</i>; move L behind R. This
            completes a 4 count <b>grapevine marching rhythm</b>.
            <b>Note</b>! The <b>grapevine marching rhythm</b> is just a combination of 2 counts of crossing steps
            and 2 counts of Serbian kolo steps!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Balance cross step</b> as <b>marching rhythm</b>
            <b>Turning step</b> as <b>marching rhythm</b>: step R, L crosses in front of R, R turns
            <i>in place</i>, L continues to cross R. This creates a 4 count <b>turn marching rhythm</b>
            turning right! To turn left, the L turns <i>in place</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Hora rhythms</b> are when one or more of the 4 counts are <i>nonsteps</i>!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Original Greek hora rhythm</b>: step R; balance on R (<i>nonstep</i>); step L; balance on L
            (<i>nonstep</i>).
            <br>
            This is the <b>Greek hora rhythm</b> which combined with a <i>moving</i> <b>marching rhythm</b> creates the
            <b>Original Greek Hora Dance</b>!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Geometry of the Original Greek hora rhythm</b> is:
            facing forward on the <i>baseline</i>, step R to your right on the <i>baseline</i>;
            balance on R while lifting L in front of the <i>baseline</i> (<i>nonstep</i>);
            step L to your left on the <i>baseline</i>;
            balance on L while lifting R in front of the <i>baseline</i>.
            This 4 count <b>rhythm</b> is done <i>in place</i>,
            without progressing either right or left.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Other Cultural Versions of the Original Greek Hora Dance</b> are the
            Turkish version (Kendeme), Early Israeli version (Zemer Atik),
            Modern Israeli version (Debka Daluna), Ukranian version (Arkan),
            <b>3 step hora</b> versions of the <b>Original Greek Hora Dance</b> are the Macedonian
            version (Oro), Turkish version (Iste Hendek), <b>Chacha (half step)
            versions of the Original Greek Hora Dance</b> are Serbian version (Setnja),
            Armenian version (Laz Bar), Bulgarian version, Serbian kolo version, Irish version (Ceili), Brittany version
            (Gavotte).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3 step hora rhythm</b>: R; L; R; R hold or L; R; L; L hold. Combining
            these two creates an 8 count <b>pattern</b> that can repeat <i>ad infinitum</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1 step hora rhythm</b>: R; R; R; R; Usually hopping three times after
            initially stepping R.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Greek Syrto hora rhythm</b>: R; R hold; L; R or L; L hold; R; L Combining
            these two creates an 8 count <b>pattern</b> that can repeat <i>ad infinitum</i>!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Geometry of Greek Syrto hora rhythm</b>: R steps on <i>baseline</i>;
            R holds while L lifts behind R; L steps behind R; R moves right stepping on <i>baseline</i>. Then, L
            Crossing R, <i>moving</i> right, facing right, steps on the <i>baseline</i>;
            L holds <i>in place</i> while R lifts facing forward; R steps in front of <i>baseline</i>;
            L steps back <i>in place</i> on <i>baseline</i>; R steps <i>in place</i> on <i>baseline</i>;
            R holds while L lifts facing forward; L steps in front of <i>baseline</i>.
            This 16 count <b>Greek Syrto hora rhythm</b> repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            I see the <b>Greek Syrto Dance</b> as an elegant enhancement of the <b>Greek Hora Dance</b>
            with the right <i>moving</i> part being 8 counts instead of just 4 counts
            and the second <i>in place</i> part also being 8 counts instead of 4 counts!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Chacha rhythm</b>: R; L; RLR where the second L is a half step!
        </p>
        <p>
            The count is 1; 2; 3&amp;4 with &amp; representing the <i>half step</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Double chacha rhythm</b>: RLR; LRL or in count: 1&amp;2; 3&amp;4.
            This symmetrical <b>rhythm</b> is like the <b>Greek hora rhythm</b> and is used by many
            cultures as a more dynamic substitute.
            But, not the Greeks, who have resolutely preserved this first dance for 3,000 years!
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Scissors step</i> occurs when one steps <i>in place</i>
            and simultaneously extends the other foot in front,
            then does the same move stepping with the other foot, creating a 2 count scissors effect.

            <h2>Marching Step Folk Dances</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Marching step rhythm</b> folk dances are done in a R, L, R, L regular rhythm. In the Greek
                tradition they begin with the R foot and compose 8 count <b>patterns</b> by combining two 4 count R,
                L, R, L <b>steps</b>. <i>Note that we use the <b>step rhythm</b> in bold to mean 4 whole number counts
                of
                music!</i>
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Ve David Version 1</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q3J02vjA5fM"></iframe>
            <p>
                The music Ve David is a wonderful example of a <b>marching step rhythm</b> regular
                rhythm done in two 4 count <b>steps</b> creating an 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This first version begins facing forward, moving forward: R, L, R, L.
                Then, still facing forward, move backward: R, L, R, L.
                That completes your first 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second 8 counts use a <b>cross step rhythm</b> moving left: R in front, L
                moves left behind R, R moves left in front again, L follows behind R.
                Repeat this left moving <b>cross step rhythm</b> to complete the 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
                Please note, the <b>cross step rhythm</b> is done facing forward! That is quite unlike
                a <b>marching step rhythm</b>, which would face left when moving left!
            </p>
            <p>
                The third <b>pattern</b> is a L turn step: R crosses L, L steps in place,
                R crosses, L steps in place. The L stepping in place with the R
                crossing it creates a rotation around it and transforms a <b>cross step rhythm</b>
                into a <b>turn step rhythm</b>! Repeat this L turn step to complete the pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fourth <b>pattern</b> is repeating the first: marching forward then
                backwards still facing forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fifth <b>pattern</b>, like the second, is two <b>cross steps</b>, but only moving
                right this time: R steps right, L steps in front of R, R steps right again,
                L follows in front of R. Repeat the right moving <b>cross step rhythm</b>, remembering
                all the while you are facing forward!
            </p>
            <p>
                The sixth and final <b>pattern</b> is a <b>turn step rhythm</b> around your R:
                R steps in place, L crosses R, R steps in place, L continues to cross
                R creating a right <b>turning step rhythm</b>. Repeat this step and that completes
                the dance! The dance can be repeated in its entirety <i>ad infinitum</i>!
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Ve David Version 2</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sm5bzWLfL0Q"></iframe>
            <p>
                Ve David version 2 is modelled after version 1, and begins with the same <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and backward.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second 8 counts move left, but this time the crossing steps are both in front and in back: R crosses
                in front of L, L moves left of R, R crosses in back of L, L moves left of R.
                This is the most elegantly flowing <b>step rhythm</b> to come out of the Classical World, or any world
                since,
                in my opinion!
                This <b>step rhythm</b> is generally called a <b>grapevine step rhythm</b>, but, in this special case
                since it begins
                with the R (Greek tradition) while moving left (Jewish tradition), we call it the Jewish
                <b>grapevine step rhythm</b>!
                Repeat this Jewish <b>grapevine step rhythm</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third <b>pattern</b> combines two <b>cross steps</b> in place facing forward: R crosses in front of
                L, L
                steps in place, R steps in place, L crosses in front of R, continuing: R in place, L in place, R
                crossing in front of L, L in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second half of the dance is similar to the first: 4 count <b>marching steps</b> forward and
                backward, then moving right with two <b>grapevine steps</b>: step right with your R, L crosses in front
                of R, R moves right of L, L crosses in back of R; repeat this 4 count <b>grapevine step rhythm</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Final 8 count <b>pattern</b>: two <b>cross steps</b> in place: step R, L crosses in front of R, R steps
                in
                place, L steps in place left of R, R crosses in front of L.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat the whole dance <i>ad infinitum</i>.

            <h3>Ve David Version 3</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_0Bw9NViols"></iframe>
            <p>
                This third dance to the music Ve David is
                particularly important because it emphasizes
                using two different 4 count <b>steps</b> to create
                an 8 count <b>pattern</b>! Previously, the one 4 count
                step was repeated to make an 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two 4 count <b>step rhythm</b>s in the second part of
                this third version are the <b>grapevine step rhythm</b> and
                the <b>cross over step rhythm</b> combining to create the
                8 count <b>pattern</b>! One should recognize the
                other parts the dance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our fourth version, unlike its predecessors, does not introduce
                any new 4 count <b>steps</b> but attempts to do more than just express
                the mathematical structure of the music by arranging the 8 count
                <b>patterns</b> such that they also express the non-mathematical feeling
                the music conveys!
            </p>
            <p>
                To accomplish that, the first part of the dance uses a <b>marching step rhythm</b>
                moving to the right and back, then, as in the other versions: forward
                and back. The second part is an 8 count <b>cross step rhythm</b> in place: R,
                L crossing R, R in place, L in place, R crossing L,
                L in place R in place, L crossing R. The third part continues
                the <b>cross step rhythm</b>: R in place, L in place, R cross L, L in place,
                followed by a 4 count <b>turn step rhythm</b> around the L. This third part
                repeats. Then the whole dance repeats, but the fourth time you
                need to repeat the third part a second time for it to feel right!

            <p>
                This is our first dance that is presented in its
                original pre-COVID choreography except for dancing
                separately! La Ahavti Dai begins with two 4 count <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>
                plus two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b> in place.
                Then these two 8 count <b>patterns</b> are repeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part involves <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and back plus 4 count <b>marching steps</b> moving right
                with 4 count <b>turning steps</b> around R foot. Then,
                these two 8 count <b>patterns</b> are repeated,
                and that is the dance.

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gb0py_LWWaw"></iframe>
            <p>
                Our sixth dance uses the music, Yasmin. This dance
                features the <b>grapevine step rhythm</b> in its most common form,
                moving right in contrast to the Jewish version!
            </p>
            <p>
                The first 8 count <b>pattern</b> is a combination of a <b>marching step rhythm</b>
                moving forward and a <b>turning step rhythm</b> 180 degrees
                around your L foot. This <b>pattern</b> is then repeated such
                that your new forward takes you back to where you
                began, repeat these two <b>patterns</b> then repeat the first
                <b>pattern</b> such that you end up in front. Follow this with
                two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around your L foot.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part begins with an 8 count <b>pattern</b> that
                combines a <b>grapevine step rhythm</b> with an in place <b>grapevine step rhythm</b>,
                facing forward. This <b>pattern</b> is repeated a right.
                Return L to where you began, doing an 8 count <b>cross
                steps</b>. Then do two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around
                your L foot and repeat this second part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat the whole dance <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note! <b>patterns</b> are 8 count, <b>steps</b> are 4 count.
                Any two <b>steps</b> can be combined to create a <b>pattern</b>!
                Also, any music you can tap your foot to, you can count,
                and hence, express using combinations of classical
                folk dance <b>steps</b>!

            <h3>Mayim</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n3f_mOCIBlo"></iframe>
            <p>
                The music for our seventh marching folk dance is Mayim,
                and like Lo Ahavti Dai, is taught as it was originally done,
                except for a final 8 count hopping and turning
                around your L foot. The <b>buzz step rhythm</b> is the ultimate
                folk dancing <b>step rhythm</b> for expressing music, like Mayim, that suddenly doubles
                in tempo!
            </p>
            <p>
                Mayim begins with two 8 count <b>patterns</b> of 4 <b>Jewish grapevine
                steps</b>, followed by two 8 count <b>patterns</b> of 4 <b>marching steps</b>
                moving forward and backward, singing "mayim, mayim,
                mayim, mayim" each time you go forward! The finale is
                marching right in 4 big steps to where you began then
                hopping double time in place on your R foot for 8 counts
                followed by hopping in place double time on your L foot
                while swinging your R foot to help you turn around your
                L foot for 8 counts! This doubly fast in place <b>turn step rhythm</b> is
                appropriately called a <b>buzz step rhythm</b>!

            <h2>Kolo Step Folk Dances</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Kolo step rhythm</b> dances are perfect for performing on stage because
                the dancers always face the audience while moving right and left.
                One of my Reed students' mother performed in a Serbian dance
                company which, appropriately, is where the <b>kolo step rhythm</b> originated.
            </p>
            <p>
                These dances introduce a new version of the <b>cross step rhythm</b>
                called the <b>kolo step rhythm</b>, which, like the other classical folk dance
                steps, is 4 count. The right moving <b>kolo step rhythm</b> begins, in the
                Greek tradition, with the R foot: R in front, L behind,
                R in front, L behind; however, the left moving <b>kolo step rhythm</b>,
                in unGreek manner, begins with the L foot: L in front, R
                behind, L in front, R behind!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Ersko Kolo</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3c0GpvDTfGk"></iframe>
            <p>
                The music for our first Kolo dance is Ersko Kolo and its choreography,
                with the addition of <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>, is the
                original Serbian form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ersko Kolo begins moving right with two 4 count <b>kolo steps</b>, continuing
                with two 4 count <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>, then two more <b>kolo steps</b>
                followed by one <b>kolo grapevine</b> and a transition step R and hold for
                counts 2, 3, and 4. Then do the mirror image of the above moving left,
                ending holding your L for counts 2, 3, 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of the dance involves marching forward: R, L, R,
                R hold, then marching backward: L, R, L, L hold. Repeat this
                8 count <b>pattern</b> marching to your right then backward to where you began!
                Repeat the two 8 count <b>patterns</b> of the second part and that is the dance!
                Repeat <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>kolo step rhythm</b> inspired its own whole genre of folk dances, and I suspect
                that it also inspired Celtic tribes, migrating west through the Balkans, to
                create their own kolo version, which became Irish dancing.

            <h3>Alunelul</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6N6-WinRaUc"></iframe>
            <p>
                The music for our second kolo dance is Alunelul.
                The choreography has remained the same at Reed
                since the '50s when I learned it using a 78 rpm
                record for the music.
                The 8 count <b>patterns</b> are all combinations of
                <b>kolo steps + hold steps + stomp-lift steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first <b>pattern</b> is a <b>kolo step rhythm</b> moving right: R in front, L behind, R in
                front, L behind; in place step R, hold R while stomp-lifting L two counts, hold
                R.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second 8 count <b>pattern</b> is like the first only moving left: L in front, R
                behind, L in front, R behind; L in front, L hold while stomp-lifting R two
                counts, L hold. Repeat these two 8 count <b>patterns</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next 8 count <b>pattern</b> is a combination <b>kolo steps</b> moving right and
                left: step R in front, L behind, R in front, R hold while stomp-lifting L;
                followed by the reverse, moving left: L in front, R behind, L in front, L hold
                while stomp-lifting R.
                Repeat this 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last 8 count <b>patterns</b> are done <b>in place</b>; step R, R hold while
                stomp-lifting L, step L, L hold while stomp-lifting R; step R, R hold while
                stomp-lifting L two counts, R hold; followed by the reverse: step L, L hold
                while stomp-lift R, R, R hold while stomp-lift L; step L, hold L while
                stomp-lifting R twice, L hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat the dance until you are the last dancer standing!
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>kolo step rhythm</b> like the <b>buzz step rhythm</b> is typically a double
                time step! Not for the timid dancer.
                Sometimes, to emphasize how interchangeable
                <b>kolo and buzz steps</b> are we will do Alunelul using <b>buzz steps</b>
                with clapping instead of stomp-lifts!

            <p>
                Jewish Klezmer music presents an ideal tempo for
                the <b>kolo step rhythm</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                The first <b>pattern</b> in our third kolo dance is constructed
                with two <b>kolo steps</b> moving right. The second 8 counts
                are two: R, L, R, R hold while L foot lifts,
                4 counts moving forward, then 4 counts moving
                backward. The third <b>pattern</b> is two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>
                moving left, of course, followed by 6 in-place cross
                steps: R crossing L, L in place, R in place, L
                crossing R, R in place, L in place with a two-step
                turn around L foot to complete the 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat these four 8 count <b>patterns</b>. You should be back
                where the dance began!
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is done marching forward 4 steps then
                in place 4 counts: L hold while pointing R foot to
                R side, L hold again, L hold while pointing R
                foot again, L foot hold. Note, these 4 counts are done
                while remaining on your L foot! The next 8 counts are
                done moving sideways, first to the right: R, L, R,
                R hold, then to the left: L, R, L, L hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat this second part, only marching backward 4
                counts with the same 4 counts remaining on your L
                foot and the same 8 count <b>pattern</b> moving sideways: to
                the right, then to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a glorious, exhilarating dance you will want to do
                <i>ad infinitum</i>!

            <p>
                The more contemporary Israeli music, Hora, inspires
                being expressed with a combination of <b>kolo steps</b> and
                <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It begins with a <b>kolo grapevine step rhythm</b> in place + 4 steps moving
                forward followed by a <b>kolo grapevine step rhythm</b> in place and 4 steps
                moving backward to where the dance began.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part moves to the right with a <b>kolo step rhythm</b> + a
                <b>kolo grapevine step rhythm</b>, continuing right with a <b>kolo step rhythm</b> + a reduced
                <b>kolo grapevine step rhythm</b>: R in front, L behind, R behind, R
                hold! Repeat this second part moving left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then repeat the first part twice! followed by a reduced second
                part: <b>kolo step rhythm</b> + <b>kolo grapevine step rhythm</b> continuing right with a
                reduced <b>kolo step rhythm</b>: R in front, L behind, R in front,
                R hold! Repeat this reduced second part moving left!
            </p>
            <p>
                That is the dance, but remember to do the first part twice
                after the beginning!

            <h2>Greek Hora Step Folk Dances</h2>
            <p>
                The <b>hora step rhythm</b>, like the <b>kolo step rhythm</b> and <b>grapevine step rhythm</b>;
                is in 4 counts! But, unlike them, not all the 4 counts
                are expressed with stepping! This break from constant
                stepping 4 counts revolutionized the world of dance
                because it allowed different ethnic groups to express
                their own individuality!
            </p>
            <p>
                And it all began in ancient Greece 3,000 years ago!

            <p>
                The original Greek <b>hora dance</b> is just one 8 count <b>pattern</b>,
                combining a 4 count <b>marching step rhythm</b> moving right with a
                4 count <b>hora step rhythm</b> in place facing forward: R in place,
                R hold while lifting L, L in place, L hold while lifting
                R. This <b>pattern</b> is then repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>, or til one
                falls off the edge of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remarkably, this earliest dance is still done today just as
                it was done 3,000 years ago!
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: because the Greek <b>hora step rhythm</b> has two non-steps,
                the Greek tradition of <b>patterns</b> beginning with the R
                foot is retained.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wonderful music we use for dancing the Greek Hora
                is from an old 78 rpm Greek record I found in a dingy little
                New York subway shop. I only recognized one Greek word
                on the record's label: "Syrto". But, that was all I needed to
                know! It has remained my favorite Greek Hora music ever
                since.

                This exquisite Greek music contains 3 parts: <b>Greek Horas</b>, <b>chacha rhythms</b>,
                and <b>balance + cross rhythms</b>!
                Using a square as a circle and beginning at the right baseline corner of your square,
                do 3 <b>Greek Horas</b> around 3 sides ending at the left baseline corner.
                Facing the center of the square, do a <b>cha-cha rhythm</b> towards the center
                hopping on your L: R, L, LRL Then do the same backwards. Then forward
                again, finishing with a <b>marching rhythm</b> backward.
                Move right along your baseline with a R, L balance 2 steps, in place,
                + a R, L moving right cross 2 steps. Repeat this new 4 count
                <b>balance + cross marching rhythm</b> three times to end up where you began, eager
                to do the dance again and again and again!

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 3: Jewish Version</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KMeVqh7I5RM"></iframe>
            <p>
                Our third example of the <b>Greek hora</b> includes the Jewish version.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance begins marching to the right 4 counts plus a 4 count <b>Greek hora step rhythm</b>
                in place facing forward. Repeat these 8 counts three more
                times, then do a 4 count R <b>turn step rhythm</b> as a transition step to the
                Jewish version: facing forward, step R in place; R hold while kicking L,
                step L, L hold while kicking R. Then move L doing a
                <b>Jewish grapevine</b> for your 4 count <b>marching step rhythm</b>. Repeat these 8 counts
                three more times ending back where you began the dance! Repeat
                all of this <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note! The 4 count transition step is needed because the Jewish
                version reverses the order of the two 4 count <b>step rhythm</b>s:
                beginning with the <b>hora step rhythm</b>, then the <b>marching grapevine step rhythm</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will use our same exquisite <b>Greek hora</b> music for this dance.

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 4: Zemer Atik</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KMeVqh7I5RM"></iframe>
            <p>
                This Israeli version of the Greek <b>hora step rhythm</b> dance is called
                Zemer Atik. It begins right 4 counts. Then
                continue facing right: step R, and hold R while you clap
                twice, step L, and hold L while clapping once, completing an
                8 count Israeli version of the <b>Greek hora</b>. Repeat this
                a total of four times going around a 12-by-12 foot square,
                ending where you began.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is a second Israeli
                version of the <b>Greek hora</b> that retains the older Jewish
                tradition of reversing the order of the two 4 count <b>step rhythm</b>s,
                doing the <b>hora step rhythm</b> first: step R towards the center of
                your square, hold R while snapping your fingers, step L,
                hold L while snapping your fingers. Then step backward 4
                counts to where you began. Repeat this second part a total
                of four times to be commensurate with the first part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then repeat both parts <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A personal note regarding this version of the <b>Greek hora</b>:
                Over the decades, I've tried to convince Israeli dancers that
                their dance, Zemer Atik, is just a variation of the <b>Greek hora</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have never been successful!
            </p>

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 5: Debka Daluna</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hHLBIUTt6mQ"></iframe>
            <p>
                This second Israeli version of the <b>Greek hora</b> is also
                a variation of Zemer Atik, substituting stomp-lifts for claps!
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance begins with a two step <b>kolo</b> moving right
                followed by a 4 count <b>hora step rhythm</b> facing forward: R
                in place, R hold while stomp-lifting twice with your
                L foot, step L, L hold while stomp-lifting your R
                foot. Repeat this 6 count <b>pattern</b> three more times
                moving right during the two step <b>kolo</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is designed to put you back to where
                you began the dance. This is accomplished by drifting left
                while moving forward 4 steps: R step, L step, R
                step plus R hop, L step. Followed by 4 steps backward
                drifting left. After repeating this 8 count forward and
                backward while drifting left you should be in a position to
                do the dance anew.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note! A stomp-lift is not a step! You don't change the
                foot supporting your weight! However, a stomp is a
                step! Similarly, a hop or skip are not steps, but a leap,
                especially of faith, is.

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 6: Arkan</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pz8QNL8wNP8"></iframe>
            <p>
                This Ukrainian version of the <b>Greek hora</b> is called Arkan.
                Like Debka Daluna, it begins with a two step <b>kolo</b> moving right, followed by a
                <b>Greek hora step rhythm</b>. This 6 count <b>pattern</b>
                is repeated three more times.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part entails combining <b>marching steps</b> moving left to return to your beginning point:
                For your first marching
                L <b>pattern</b>, do 24 counts of <b>cross steps</b> L, then repeat the
                <b>hora step rhythm</b> part, which miraculously is also 24 counts. Your
                second marching left will be 6 <b>Jewish grapevine</b> which
                just happens to also be 24 counts. Repeat the <b>hora</b> part.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third marching left is a combination of a 4 count <b>cross step rhythm</b>
                and a <b>Jewish grapevine step rhythm</b> done three times or
                24 counts. Repeat the <b>hora</b> part before your fourth variation
                of the marching left part where you combine the <b>cross step rhythm</b>
                with two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>, giving you two twelve
                count <b>patterns</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You then repeat this dance while changing the <b>hora steps</b>:
                The first change is to make the L lift steps, L stomp-lift!
                The second time switch to your R lift steps, making them
                R stomp-lift. Then the third time make both lift steps,
                stomp-lift steps and the fourth time, as a finale, make the
                stomp-lift steps double-stomp-lift steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                A personal note! When I was a student at pre-COVID Reed,
                Arkan was one of the most popular dances, especially when
                we would form a circle and every other dancer, with the support
                of dancers on either side, would suspend with feet extended in
                front of us on the floor, and then simultaneously flip over backward,
                hopefully landing upright. After my first year of doing this dance,
                I gave up wearing a wristwatch. The watch band was too often
                a casualty of the flip!

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 7: Hava Nagila</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/33J7PidG1Sk"></iframe>
            <p>
                This Jewish version of the Greek Hora is probably the most
                familiar of all the different ethnic versions!
            </p>
            <p>
                Hava Nagila begins with four 8 count combinations of a <b>Greek hora step rhythm</b>
                with a <b>Jewish grapevine step rhythm</b>, followed by 8 counts
                of two <b>Greek hora steps</b> and 8 counts of a <b>buzz step rhythm</b> around
                your R foot. These last two 8 count <b>patterns</b> are repeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, facing forward, moving backward: step R while clapping,
                hold R, step L while clapping, hold L followed by four steps
                backward while clapping with each step. Continue facing forward
                hopping in place on your R foot 8 counts, then hop on your L
                foot 8 counts. Repeat these two 8 counts of hopping in place,
                followed by turning moving right: R, L, R, R hold and
                clap plus turning moving left: L, R, L, L hold and clap.
                And, that is our version of Hava Nagila.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: The part facing forward, moving backward is another version
                of the Greek Hora in the Jewish form of reversing the order of
                <b>marching step rhythm</b> and <b>hora step rhythm</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, if you listen carefully, you can hear the needle dropping onto
                the 78 Michael Herman Folk-dancer recording of our Hava Nagila
                music.

            <h3>Greek Hora Folk Dance 8: Hora Agadati</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2cQ6m5pUQAY"></iframe>
            <p>
                This is another Israeli version of the Greek Hora.
                It was originally choreographed as a line dance,
                but for pandemic times, it can be done along the
                sides of a 12-foot square. Beginning at the bottom
                L corner, run R 4 steps, then bounce in place
                4 counts. Repeat this <b>pattern</b> along each side of
                the square, returning to the bottom L corner.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is done in place facing forward
                with two <b>hora steps</b>: step R, R hold while
                touching L heel in front, step L, hold L while
                touching your R toe to your R side. Repeat
                this <b>hora step rhythm</b>. For the next 8 count <b>pattern</b>: in
                place, bounce L, bounce R, bounce L, stomp
                R in front; then: step L in place, hold L, hold
                L while clapping three times with the music.
                Repeat this 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note! Hora Agadati has the same mathematical
                structure as Hava Nagila: They each are constructed
                with two parts having four 8 count <b>patterns</b>.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Evolution of Greek Hora</h3>
            <p>
                The Greek Hora soon spread throughout the Classical World!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my opinion, it was the R hold and L hold part of
                the <b>Greek hora step rhythm</b> that made it so dramatically popular, because
                the two holds encouraged the various ethnic peoples to express
                their individuality and embrace the dance as their own!
            </p>
            <p>
                The result was: the form of the <b>Greek hora step rhythm</b> changed with
                each ethnic adoption of the dance, making the <b>Greek hora step rhythm</b>
                no longer definable by its form. The Greek Hora had evolved
                beyond form to rhythm and the future of folk dancing would become
                more and more about rhythm instead of form.
            </p>
            <p>
                To emphasize the difference between form and rhythm we will
                give our <b>marching step rhythm</b> forms a Greek Hora rhythm!
            </p>
            <!-- This true subsection is intentional -->
            <h4>Greek Hora as a Rhythm</h4>

            <p>
                Using our basic 8 count music, Ve David: march facing forward:
                R, L, R, L, then backward: R, hold R, L, hold L. For the second
                8 counts <b>cross step rhythm</b> left: R crossing L, L stepping left, R crossing L,
                L stepping left, then continuing: R crossing L, R hold, L stepping left,
                L hold. The third 8 counts are: R turning around L, L in place, R
                around L, L in place, then R turning around L, R hold, L in place, L hold. Repeat the forward and
                backward 8 counts and the <b>cross step rhythm</b>
                8 counts, only moving right this time, Also 8 counts around the R, all in Greek Hora rhythm!
            </p>
            <p>
                Then repeat the first forward and backward part, and the crossing
                steps part only moving to your right this time, and the turning steps,
                moving around your R this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                After which, you can start over: substituting <b>grapevine marching steps</b>
                for the <b>cross steps</b> and <b>cross steps</b> in place for the
                <b>turn steps</b>. And, for the particularly adventurist dancers, you can
                create your own combinations of <b>marching steps</b> to do as a
                Greek Hora rhythm!

            <h2>Three-step Hora Step Folk Dances</h2>
            <p>
                The Greek Hora was not only transformed in form as it
                spread throughout the ancient world creating a multitude
                of ethnic versions, its rhythm also changed!

            <h3>Iste Hendek</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ioc7Me31Do"></iframe>
            <p>
                The earliest example of this is a 3-step Hora Step as
                represented by the Turkish dance, Iste Hendek which
                expresses a 1, 2, 3, hold rhythm rather than the <b>Greek hora step's:</b>
                1, hold, 3, hold rhythm! Iste Hendek compensates
                for having only one hold by repeating its 3-step <b>hora step rhythm</b>
                so that its 8 count <b>pattern</b> will contain two holds just like
                the 8 count Greek Hora! Also, like the Greek Hora, Iste
                Hendek begins with the R foot and ends its 8 count <b>pattern</b>
                on its L foot, ready to repeat ad infinitum, with appropriate
                Turkish changes in form, of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dance begins facing forward: step forward R, step
                forward L, forward R, hold R while lifting L, followed by:
                stepping backward L, backward R, backward L, hold L
                twisting L and R while remaining on your L. I refer
                to this as a Turkish twist. Repeat this 8 count <b>pattern</b> three
                more times. The second <b>pattern</b> builds on the first by substituting:
                double stomp forward R instead of just forward R, as the third count!
                The fourth count remains: R hold while lifting L.
                This second <b>pattern</b> like the first is repeated 3 more times.
                The third <b>pattern</b> changes the form of the first by substituting skip
                backward for the lift. Remember, a skip, like a lift, is not
                a step. We refer to this skip backward as a Turkish chug.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third 8 counts only repeats once. The fourth (and last)
                <b>pattern</b> embellishes the third by adding a double stomp
                before the Turkish chug, and replaces the Turkish twist
                with a more exuberant stomp twist! This <b>pattern</b> is repeated
                once.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance does not repeat exactly with the music we use:
                the first <b>pattern</b> repeats only once, but the second <b>pattern</b>
                still repeats 3 times, while the third <b>pattern</b> repeats once,
                the fourth <b>pattern</b> repeats until the needle falls off our 45
                recording!
            </p>

            <p>
                Like the <b>Greek hora step, </b>the 3-step <b>hora step </b>evolved into
                multifarious forms but its rhythm remained constant! To
                emphasize its unique rhythm, we will give our Ve David model
                of <b>marching steps </b>a 3-step <b>hora step rhythm</b> rhythm, just as we did
                with the <b>Greek hora step rhythm</b> rhythm.

            <p>
                This exquisite Bulgarian music expresses the 3-step Hora rhythm.
                We will dance along the four sides of a square. Beginning in the
                lower left corner move right two 3-step <b>hora steps</b>. Repeat this
                8 count <b>pattern</b> as you go around the square back to where you
                began. The second part combines a <b>Greek hora step rhythm</b> and
                a 3-step <b>hora step rhythm</b> moving right, then moving left back to the
                beginning Repeat this second part. Then repeat your circuit
                around the square adding three 8 count 3-step <b>hora steps</b> turning
                around your R foot. Repeat the second part adding four 8 count <b>buzz steps</b>:
                first around R, then around L, around R, around L. Repeat going around the
                square and second part. Then a final circuit adding just one 8 count
                turning around your R, plus a final second part.
                And that is final! Unless you want to repeat the dance!

            <p>
                This enchanting Israeli music is all 3-step <b>hora rhythm</b> music!

                It begins facing forward moving sideways stepping R, step L next to R,
                step R, hold R. Then do the same moving left. Repeat this 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
                The second part is facing and moving forward keeping R in front: R, L, R,
                R hold; then backward keeping L in back: L, R, L, L hold. Repeat this 8
                count <b>pattern</b>. Repeat the first part but only one 8 count <b>pattern</b> of the
                second part.

                The third 3-step <b>hora rhythm</b> is still facing forward: step
                forward to the right, forward L, cross L with R, hold R. Then forward L,
                forward R, cross R with L, L hold. Repeat this 8 count <b>pattern</b>. Still
                facing forward moving backward keeping the R ahead: R, L, R, hold R,
                then continue L ahead: L, R, L, hold L. Repeat this 8 count, and you
                should be back where you began!

                You then start over adding two more
                8 count <b>patterns</b> to the seven you did the first time. And, then repeat
                the two 8 count <b>patterns</b> going forward and backward; concluding the
                dance with the side to side part til the music ends.

            <p>
                This 3-step <b>hora rhythm</b> is expressed much like it is to the
                music, Enchant. You begin facing and moving forward: R, L, R
                crossing L, R hold; continue: L, R, L crossing R, L hold; then:
                R, L, R crossing L, quick two-step turn around L. Then immediately:
                step L, R, L crossing R, L hold; R, L, R crossing L, R hold;
                L, R, L crossing R, slow four-step turn around R to transition into
                the second part: Remain facing forward: step in front with R,
                in place L, R in place, R hold; then: stepping back: L, R, L, L hold.
                Repeat this 8 count <b>pattern</b> three more times, returning to your
                original spot. See video to learn the arm movements that complement
                this second part! In general, hand/arm movements mirror foot/leg
                movements: in this dance, when your R foot steps in front, your
                hands also move forward in front of your face, and as you slowly
                move backward, your hands/arms slowly descend.

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/laZrSszkPvE"></iframe>
            <p>
                This example of the 3-step <b>hora</b> is done to the Russian music, Troika. As the name implies, this
                dance was originally intended to be done by groups of 3 dancers; which we will do when we are not having
                a pandemic. Meanwhile, we can still enjoy dancing to this voluptuous music by creating an individualized
                version.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our version begins facing forward stepping moving forward 8 counts in Russian style; then moving
                backward 8 counts to where you began. The next two 8 counts are combinations of 3-step <b>hora steps</b>
                in place facing forward: R stomping in front of L while clapping, L in place, R in place, R hold; L
                stomping in front of R while clapping, R in place, L in place, L hold. Repeat these two 3-step
                <b>hora step rhythm</b> rhythms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second half of the dance involves <b>grapevine steps</b> moving left: three Jewish
                <b>grapevine steps</b>, then step R, hop on your R three times in place; with your L free move right
                three Jewish
                <b>grapevine steps</b>, step L, hop on L three times in place. This completes four 8 counts, making the
                second half commensurate with the first half.

            <h3>Korobushka (Korobeiniki)</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WZGg0EDXUdo"></iframe>
            <p>
                This Russian dance features two examples of moving 3-step Hora rhythms, which are quite different
                from the in-place 3-step Hora <b>steps</b> previously described for Troika!
            </p>
            <p>
                Korobushka begins facing forward, moving forward: R, L, R, R hop while lifting L; then moving backward:
                L, R, L, L hop while lifting R: moving forward again: R, L, R, L; then L hop while R crosses in front of
                L, L hop again while R moves back in place with your weight remaining on L, R moves to meet L clicking
                the heels of your Russian boots, L hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of this dance begins with a moving right 3-step <b>hora</b> while turning around your R:
                R, L, R, R hold while clapping; then do the same only moving to your left: L, R, L, L hold while
                clapping; facing forward in place R, R hold while snapping fingers, L, L hold while snapping fingers,
                followed by 4 count <b>marching step rhythm</b> moving backward clapping: you're doing an 8 count Jewish
                Greek
                Hora moving backward rather than moving left!
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat this second part and that completes our second exuberant Russian dance.

            <p>
                This music involves a variety of 2-step 4 count <b>steps.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance begins moving right with a <b>kolo step rhythm</b> followed
                by a <b>kolo step in place.</b> This 8 count <b>pattern</b> repeats
                three more times.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is done moving forward: R, L, L hold while
                stomp-lifting R twice. Repeat these 4 counts, moving backward,
                still facing forward. This will complete the 8 count <b>pattern</b>!
                Which, you will repeat just once!
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving to your left, facing forward do two 8 count <b>patterns</b> of
                <b>cross steps</b>. Remember your first step will be with your R
                crossing in front of your L while moving left. Emphasize your
                R steps by making them R stomping steps. After the16 counts
                moving left, you should be back where you began.
            </p>
            <p>
                Facing forward <b>in place</b>: step R behind, L in place, R slap in front
                with a flat foot, held for 2 counts. Repeat these 4 counts three more
                times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now do a left <b>turn step rhythm</b> stomping with both feet as you turn left
                8 counts. Then, reverse that, turning backward 8 counts, so that,
                you are facing forward again!
            </p>
            <p>
                This next part is basically the second part done <b>in place</b> with
                the two steps done as scissor steps: R while you extend your L
                in front, L while you extend your R in front, (these two steps creates
                a scissor like effect of opening and closing), then hold L in place while
                stomp-lifting R twice to complete the 4 counts! Repeat this <b>step rhythm</b>
                three more times.
            </p>
            <p>
                The finale is facing right, moving right: R, L, R, R hold while facing
                left; then moving left: L, R, L, L hold while facing right. Repeat
                this <b>pattern</b> once. I wonder how many counts that makes?
            </p>
            <p>
                This energetic dance traditionally repeats until only one dancer
                remains! Good luck!

            <h2>1-step <b>Hora Rhythms</b></h2>
            <p>
                1-step <b>hora rhythms</b> usually involve hopping in place three counts during
                the non-stepping part: as in the dance Hava Nagila or hopping in place
                around your 1 step in the dance, Mayim, or half-way around in Troika.

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_52bAQi5Xmc"></iframe>
            <p>

                The first part of the dance is done facing forward, moving forward with a combination of a
                <b>marching step + Jewish grapevine step in place</b>, repeat this 8 count <b>pattern</b>,
                then still facing forward move backward: R, L, a total of 8 counts.
                You should be back to where you began!
                Finish this first part with two 3-step <b>hora rhythms in place</b> facing forward: R in place, L
                crossing in front of R, R in place, R hold; L, R crossing in front of L, L in place, L hold.
                Repeat this first part.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part expresses a unique form of the 1-step <b>hora</b>: it begins, as usual, stepping R
                facing right, then while remaining on your R have your L touch the floor, brush the floor, and lift
                pointing right, to complete the <b>step rhythm</b>.
                The second four counts move right: L, R, L, L hold while lifting your R facing right. Repeat this 8
                count <b>pattern</b> moving right.
                Move left with two <b>grapevine-type steps</b> beginning with R behind L ending back where you began.
                Then do two 3-step <b>hora rhythms</b> in place: R, L cross in front of R, R in place, R hold; L in
                place, R cross in front of L, L in place, L hold.
                Finish with <b>turning step in place</b> around your L 8 counts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>grapevine-type step rhythm</b> in this dance is very unusual: you are facing
                right when you begin: stepping R behind L moving left, L step left while turning
                to face forward, R stepping in front of L still moving left, L step left.
                A <b>grapevine step rhythm</b> moving left beginning with the R, is virtually always a
                <b>Jewish grapevine!</b>
                I cannot think of another exception; therefore, it must be unique!

            <h2>Greek Syrto Hora Step Dances</h2>
            <p>
                For me, the <b>Greek syrto hora</b> is the final, ultimate evolution of the <b>Greek hora</b>,
                and the most exquisite <b>step/rhythm</b> in all of dance. Although the <b>cha cha
                step/rhythm</b> has arguably become the most popular <b>step/rhythm</b> around the
                world, the <b>Greek syrto hora</b> remained uniquely Greek until the Reed Folk
                Dancing Class.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b> is: R, R hold, L, R, then L, L hold, R, L repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>Greek syrto hora</b> has only been done to Greek music, it never spread everywhere like its
                predecessor, the <b>Greek hora</b>. And, never evolved into multifarious ethnic versions with
                multifarious
                ethnic music until the Reed Folk Dance Class!

            <p>
                We will use our standard 8 count model music,
                Ve David,
                to express our <b>marching steps</b> with <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>:
                facing forward,
                moving forward:
                step R;
                R hold;
                L;
                R;
                continuing forward:
                L;
                L hold;
                R;
                L;
                facing forward moving backwards:
                R;
                R hold;
                L;
                R;
                continuing backwards:
                L;
                L hold;
                R;
                L;
                You should be back where you began!
                Move left 8 counts crossing in front with R;
                Then move around your L 8 more counts,
                always with a <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>.
                Repeat the two 8 counts moving forward and backward;
                followed by 8 counts of moving right with <b>cross steps</b> and around your R 8 counts with <b>turn
                steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will make the next part linear by substituting cross steps in place
                for the forward and backward <b>patterns</b>: in place cross R in front of L,
                R hold, L in place, R in place; L in front of R, L hold, R in place,
                L in place; Then: moving cross steps left 8 counts as before and turning
                around your left as in the first part, and repeat the 8 counts of cross steps in
                place, followed by 8 counts of moving cross step right and 8 counts of
                turn steps around your R. Repeat this linear movement left and right plus
                a third left. All in Greek <b>syrto rhythm</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                The last part is the same linear description except the right moving cross
                step begins with a right moving kolo grapevine step.
            </p>
            <p>

                You should be back where you began this dance eager to repeat it countless times!
                expressing the unique <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b> all the while!

            <p>
                This is Israeli music that emphasizes the <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>. We will
                use the original form for expressing the <b>Greek syrto steps</b>: facing forward
                step R; R hold while lifting L behind R; step L behind R; moving and facing
                right while stepping R; (this 4 count <b>step rhythm</b> is the closest the Greeks ever came
                to creating a <b>grapevine step rhythm</b>) continue moving right, crossing R, step L;
                L hold; moving right, facing right, step R; moving right step L while facing
                forward. This completes the first 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
                The second 8 counts are done <b>in place facing forward</b>: step R; R hold
                while lifting L; L step in front; R in place; L in place; L hold while lifting R;
                R steps in front; L in front; and that completes the second 8 count <b>pattern</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                The second half of the dance is a repeat of these two 8 count <b>patterns</b>,
                only moving left to end up where we began:
                facing forward, step R;
                R hold while lifting L behind R;
                step L behind R;
                moving and facing left while stepping R;
                continue moving and facing left, step L;
                L hold;
                step R;
                step L while facing forward.
                The second 8 counts <b>in place facing forward</b> are exactly as described for the first half.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, Greek dances did not move to the left. But , when Greeks
                immigrated to America, to start a new life, they created a new version
                of their <b>syrto hora</b> called the Greek Misirlou, and it moves left and right
                as we will soon see!

            <p>
                This second <b>Greek syrto</b> music is also not Greek;
                it is not even from the greater world of Alexander!
                It is rather American Pop/Country music!
                But, it is the clearest expression of <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b> I have ever heard!
                And, more importantly, it incites one to go outside the original form of the very linear <b>Greek
                syrto</b>,
                which we will refer to as <b>standard linear syrto form</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                The dance begins with the <b>standard linear syrto form</b>:
                moving right two 8 count <b>patterns</b> of <b>syrto</b>;
                then left two 8 counts;
                then repeat this right and left <b>linear syrto</b> with its last 2 counts expressed as a 2-step
                180-degree turn around your L:
                R in front, L turn in place 180 degrees;
                Facing and moving south of the <b>syrto line</b> in <b>syrto rhythm:</b> step R, R hold, L, R;
                L, L hold, R, L while turning in place 180 degrees;
                now, facing forward: R in place, R hold, L steps behind R, R steps forward toward the right end of the
                <b>standard syrto line</b>;
                continue to syrto forward: L, L hold, R, L;
                You should be in place to go back to <b>standard form</b>:
                R in place, R hold, L in front, R in place; L in place, L hold, R in front, L in place;
                continue <b>standard syrto form </b>moving left to where we began the dance.
                Repeat this entire first part excluding:
                continue <b>standard syrto form</b> moving left to where we began the dance.
                Instead, R in place facing forward,
                R hold, L behind R, R facing left, moving left;
                L moving left,
                L hold with transition to 3-step hora rhythm moving left:
                R, L, R, R hold;
                L, R, L, L hold;
                R, L, R, R hold;
                turn 180 degrees around R:
                step L facing forward, R in place, L crossing R moving right, facing right, L hold;
                moving right:
                R, L, R, R hold;
                L, R, L, L hold;
                turn 180 degrees around L:
                step R facing forward, L in place, R crossing L facing left, R hold;
                Repeat these 3-step <b>horas</b> moving left and moving right;
                then move left for the third time:
                L, R, L, L hold;
                R, L, R, R hold;
                turn 90 degrees around R:
                step L in place facing forward,
                R in place facing forward, L cross R, L hold facing forward;
                Repeat the <b>non-standard syrto form</b> with the 180 degree turns for the third time;
                followed by <b>standard linear syrto</b> moving left, then right, left again, right again, left, then
                right, a final left before a final <b>non-standard syrto</b> with the 180 degree turns.
                Then end the dance as it began: with <b>standard linear syrto form</b>. This dance is a wonderful
                example of the freedom to move out of the box or in this case, off the line, that the <b>syrto
                rhythm</b> inspires!

            <h3>Karagouna</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X6ZoktN7h3g"></iframe>
            <p>
                Karagouna is unmistakably Greek in music and dance, featuring
                the <b>Greek syrto</b> along with 1 and 3-step <b>horas</b>. It begins facing
                forward, walking forward: stepping R, L, R, R hold while touching
                left with L; then: L in place, L hold while touching right three times
                with your R. Repeat this 8 count <b>pattern</b> walking backward while
                still facing forward. You should be where you began! Repeat this
                first part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second part: moving right doing a <b>kolo step rhythm</b> double stamping with
                your R as you move right 8 counts. You should be on your L:
                The next 8 counts are done <b>in place</b>: L hold while you touch right
                side with R, L hold while touching again with R, double hop with L
                while you turn left, step R in front of L. Reverse these 4 counts:
                Starting with R hold while you touch left with L, R hold while touching
                again with L, double hop with R while turning left, step L in front
                of R. This completes two 8 count <b>patterns</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third part, like the second, consists of two 8 count <b>patterns</b>: This
                time, as a finale for the dance, the two <b>patterns</b> are appropriately two
                <b>Greek syrto horas</b> moving left back to where you can eagerly repeat
                all three parts!

            <h3>Misirlou</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cNvT3Z7wY6o"></iframe>
            <p>
                This next dance is a different version of the <b>Greek syrto</b>, an American
                version! Greek immigrants came here to begin a new life: new language,
                new traditions and a new <b>form</b> for their cherished <b>Greek syrto</b> which is
                called Misirlou. It is the same unique <b>syrto rhythm</b>; only the <b>form</b> was
                changed: It begins facing forward in place: R, R hold while lifting L, step
                behind R with L, R in place while facing left; step left with your L, L hold
                while your R boldly crosses in front of your L moving left, R, L moving left;
                R, R hold facing left lift L, step backward with L moving back toward where
                you began, continue backward with R; and L, L hold while you face
                forward, you should be where you started, step R in place, L in place.
                Repeat these two 8 count <b>patterns</b> ad infinitum to fully enjoy this unique
                <b>form</b> of the <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                Misirlou appears to be a completely new creation; and it is in <b>form</b>,
                but <b>form</b> is deceptive and readily changeable in dance and everything
                else. What is constant about Misirlou is its <b>rhythm</b>; and that is the
                inimitable <b>Greek syrto rhythm</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                The more I think about <b>form</b> in dance, I realize that the most
                definable feature of <b>Greek syrto form</b> was retained in
                <b>Greek Misirlou form</b>! They both are <span class="underline">linear</span> in <b>form</b>?
            </p>
            <p>
                However, one change that was revolutionary about Misirlou's
                <b>form</b> was that it moves <span class="underline">left</span> as well as the
                traditional <span class="underline">right</span>!
            </p>

            <p>
                Danse is inspiring French music which deserves the inspiring
                <b>Greek syrto step rhythm</b> to express it! It begins facing forward moving
                forward 8 counts doing a <b>Greek hora rhythm</b>: step R, R hold
                while touching left with L, continue forward stepping L, L hold while
                touching right with R; Repeat these 4 counts moving forward.
                Still facing forward, move backward with the same <b>Greek hora
                rhythm</b> returning to where you began. Then repeat both 8 counts.
                The second part also begins facing forward, balancing in place:
                R, L, R, L, then moving right with a <b>grapevine step rhythm</b>. Repeat these
                8 counts. Facing forward, balance in place 4 counts followed by
                a <b>Jewish grapevine</b> moving left, of course. Repeat these 8 counts.
                Then repeat both 8 counts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third part features the much anticipated <b>Greek syrto step rhythm</b>:
                facing forward, step R in place, R hold while lifting L, step behind
                R with L, step R in place; combine with a <b>grapevine step in place</b>:
                L in front, R in place, L in back, R in place. The next 8 counts: do
                the same two steps only beginning with your L. Then repeat the
                first 8 counts beginning with your R; finishing with 8 counts turning
                around your R. Then repeat this third part, only beginning with your
                L this time and appropriately, ending by turning around your L.
                Then, repeat all 8 <b>patterns</b> of the second part and all 8 <b>patterns</b>
                of the third part finishing the dance with 2 <b>patterns</b> of the first part.
                Remember, a <b>pattern</b> is 8 counts! This is what makes the dances
                that have evolved from the <b>Greek hora</b> so mathematically elegant!

            <p>
                This Macedonian music/dance features the <b>syrto rhythm</b> and also the
                Macedonian version of the <b>Greek hora</b>, called <b>lesnoto hora</b>. This allows
                one to experience the transition from <b>Greek hora</b> to <b>Greek syrto</b>!
                The <b>lesnoto hora</b> is the <b>Greek hora</b> with added half-steps minus two
                of the moving counts: facing forward, moving right two counts with half-step
                in between: step R, R hold while lifting L as a half-step, step right in front with L,
                hold L while lifting R as a half-step; you've completed the two moving steps,
                Now continue with the 4 count <b>hora step in place</b>: still facing forward step R,
                touch L in front as half-step then lift L for the second count; then do the same
                with your L: step in place with L, touch in front with your R as a half-step,
                then lift your R for your fourth count.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please understand: if you were to remove the half-steps from this 4 count
                <b>Macedonian lesnoto hora step rhythm</b>, you would have exactly the original 4 count
                <b>Greek hora step rhythm</b>: step R, then lift L, step in place with L, lift your R
                for our fourth count!
            </p>
            <p>
                Jovano Jovanke begins with the standard <b>Greek syrto</b> moving right 16
                counts then moving left to the starting point. The second part involves
                two 6 count <b>lesnoto horas</b> moving right, then forward, then left, then backward,
                completing your circuit around a square while facing forward and in two 6 count <b>patterns</b>!
                You should be where you began the dance, ready to enthusiastically
                enjoy doing it again and again!

            <h3>Whenever Wherever</h3>
            <p>
                This final example of music is far removed from the world
                of ethnic music, but it wonderfully features the <b>Greek syrto</b>
                rhythm! And it reminds us that the rhythms of folk
                dancing transcend it; allowing one to express all countable
                music through dance!
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever wherever begins facing forward moving right with a
                half step: R, half-step L, R, L in front, R in place continue with a
                <b>grapevine step in place</b>: L behind, R in place, L in front, R in place.
                Repeat this 8 count moving left this time. Then repeat both 8 counts,
                right and left ending where you began!
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is a 3-step <b>hora</b> facing forward moving right then left.
                Repeat this 8 count <b>pattern</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, still facing forward, move forward four <b>Greek syrto steps</b>
                turning 180 degrees during the forth <b>syrto step rhythm</b>, just as we did in
                Crystal Gayle. Return, moving back four <b>Greek syrto steps</b>
                Repeat these two 16 counts, and immediately do 8 count <b>buzz step rhythm</b>
                around your right, then around your left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat all of the dance so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                This time the dance begins with the second part done twice and the
                third part also done twice and ending with the two 8 count <b>buzz steps</b>.
                Enjoy using our wonderful classical folk dance steps/rhythms to
                express this exuberant contemporary music!
