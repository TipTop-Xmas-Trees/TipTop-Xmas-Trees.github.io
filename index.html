    <h1>Course Introduction: Bill Nelson 62'</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            When I was a student at Reed, I lived a reclusive life, mainly in the chemistry building. Folk
            dancing changed all that, and it has continued to be integral to my life, allowing me to cultivate friends
            from all around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Folk dancing, first and foremost, is about the joy of moving to music, combined with the celebration of
            community. The dances are usually done in a line or circle, giving the novice dancer the support of fellow
            dancers on either side. Historically, folk dancing, as I know it, began with the Greek hora about 3,000
            years ago (as described by Homer).
        </p>
        <p>
            The class introduces students to some of the multitude of ethnic dances that have evolved from the classical
            Greek Hora during the last 3,000 years. The Jewish dance, Hava Nagila, is a famous example of a folk dance
            that evolved from the Greek Hora!
        </p>
        <p>
            Students who take the class receive all the wonderful music played in the class! And, soon, will receive
            videos of all our dances as well!

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <b>Marching step</b> folk dances are done in a right, left, right, left regular rhythm. In the Greek
                tradition they begin with the right foot and compose 8 count patterns by combining two 4 count right,
                left, right, left steps.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The music Ve David is a wonderful example of a <b>marching step</b> regular rhythm done in two 4 count
                steps combining to make 8 count patterns! This first version involves a 4 count step marching forward
                and a 4 count step marching backward creating the first 8 count pattern. Then a <b>crossing over</b> 4
                count step moving left, beginning with the right foot crossing the left, moving in a right, left, right,
                left marching rhythm. That 4 count step is repeated to create our second 8 count pattern. The third 8
                count pattern is composed of two 4 count <b>turning steps</b> with the right foot going around the left
                foot while the left remains in place! These three 8 count patterns are repeated by going forward 4
                counts and backward 4 counts then two 4 count <b>crossing steps</b> moving right this time: right, left
                in front, right, left in front and two 4 count <b>turning steps</b> going around the right foot with the
                left. in front; 8 counts. Then the whole dance repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>!
            </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Version 2 is modelled after Version 1, and begins with the same 4 count <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and back. The second 8 count pattern also moves left but this time the right foot crosses both in front
                and in back of the left foot! This is universally called a <b>grapevine step</b>, and like its
                forerunners: <b>crossing steps</b> and <b>turning steps</b>, it is a 4 count step! Repeating the 4 count
                <b>grapevine step</b> creates an 8 count <b>grapevine pattern</b> moving left. The third pattern is a
                <b>crossing step</b> in place: right cross steps left, left in place, right in place, left cross steps
                right. For the second 4 counts: right in place, left in place, right cross steps left, left in place.
                This completes an 8 count <b>cross steps</b> in place pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of this dance is similar to the first: 4 count <b>marching steps</b>, forward and back,
                then two 4 count <b>grapevine steps</b> moving right: right in place, left crossing in front, right,
                left crossing behind. Then the third is an 8 count pattern of <b>crossing steps</b> in place: right in
                place, left crossing right, right in place, left in place, right crossing left, left in place, right in
                place, left crossing right. Repeat both parts <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This second version introduces the most elegantly flowing step to come from the Classical World or any
                world since, in my opinion! The <b>grapevine step</b>! The <b>Jewish grapevine</b> is particularly
                interesting in that it follows the Greek model by beginning with the right foot while maintaining the
                Jewish tradition of moving left.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                This third dance to the music Ve David is
                particularly important because it emphasizes
                using two different 4 count steps to create
                an 8 count pattern! Previously, the one 4 count
                step was repeated to make an 8 count pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two 4 count steps in the second part of
                this third version are the <b>grapevine</b> step and
                the <b>cross over step</b> combining to create the
                8 count pattern! One should recognize the
                other parts the the dance.
            </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Our fourth version, unlike its predecessors, does not introduce
                any new 4 count steps but attempts to do more than just express
                the mathematical structure of the music by arranging the 8 count
                patterns such that they also express the nonmathematical feeling
                the music conveys!
            </p>
            <p>
                To accomplish that, the first part of the dance uses a <b>marching step</b>
                moving to the right and back, then, as in the other versions: forward
                and back. The second part is an 8 count <b>cross step</b> in place: right,
                left crossing right, right in place, left in place, right crossing left,
                left in place right in place, left crossing right. The third part continues
                the <b>cross step</b>: right in place, left in place, right cross left, left in place,
                followed by a 4 count <b>turn step</b> around the left. This third part
                repeats. Then the whole dance repeats, but the fourth time you
                need to repeat the third part a second time for it to feel right!

                original pre-COVID choreography except for dancing
                separately! La Ahavti Dai begins with two 4 count <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b>
                plus two <b>Jewish grapevine steps</b> in place.
                Then these two 8 count patterns are repeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part involves <b>marching steps</b> forward
                and back plus 4 count <b>marching steps</b> moving right
                with 4 count <b>turning steps</b> around right foot. Then,
                these two 8 count patterns are repeated,

            <p>
                Our sixth dance uses the music, Yasmin. This dance
                features the <b>grapevine step</b> in its most common form,
                moving right in contrast to the Jewish version!
            </p>
            <p>
                The first 8 count pattern is a combination of a <b>marching
                step</b> moving forward and a <b>turning step</b> 180 degrees
                around your left foot. This pattern is then repeated such
                that your new forward takes you back to where you
                began, repeat these two patterns then repeat the first
                pattern such that you end up in front. Follow this with
                two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around your left foot.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part begins with an 8 count pattern that
                combines a <b>grapevine step</b> with an in place <b>grapevine</b>,
                facing forward. This pattern is repeated continuing right.
                Return left to where you began, doing an 8 count <b>cross
                steps</b>. Then do two 4 count transition <b>turning steps</b> around
                your left foot and repeat this second part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat the whole dance <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note! Patterns are 8 count, steps are 4 count.
                Any two steps can be combined to create a pattern!
                Also, any music you can tap your foot to, you can count,
                and hence, express using combinations of classical
                folk dance steps!

            <p>
                The music for our seventh marching folk dance is Mayim,
                and like Lo Ahavti Dai, is taught as it was originally done
                with the exception of a final 8 count hopping and turning
                around your left foot. The <b>buzz step</b> is the ultimate
                folk dance step for expressing music, like Mayim, that suddenly doubles
                in tempo!
            </p>
            <p>
                Mayim begins with two 8 count patterns of <b>Jewish grapevine
                steps</b>, followed by two 8 count patterns of <b>marching steps</b>
                moving forward and backward, singing "mayim, mayim,
                mayim, mayim" each time you go forward! The finale is
                marching right in 4 big steps to where you began then
                hopping double time in place on your right foot for 8 counts
                followed by hopping in place double time on your left foot
                while swinging your right foot to help you turn around your
                left foot for 8 counts! This doubly fast in place <b>turn step</b> is
                appropriately called a <b>buzz step</b>!

        <h2>Kolo Step Folk Dances</h2>

            <p>
                These dances introduce a new version of the <b>cross step</b>
                called the <b>kolo step</b>, which, like the other classical folk dance
                steps, is 4 count. The right moving <b>kolo step</b> begins, in the
                Greek tradition, with the right foot: right in front, left behind,
                right in front, left behind; however, the left moving <b>kolo step</b>,
                in unGreek manner, begins with the left foot: left in front, right
                behind, left in front, right behind!

                The music for our first Kolo dance is Ersko Kolo and its choreography,
                with the addition of <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>, is the
                original Serbian form.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ninth marching folk dance introduces a new version of the <b>cross
                step</b> called the <b>kolo step</b>. The right moving <b>kolo step</b>, in the
                Greek tradition, begins with the right foot: right in front, left behind, right
                in front, left behind; however, the left moving <b>kolo step</b>, in unGreek
                manner, begins with the left foot: left in front, right behind, left in front,
                right behind!
            </p>
            <p>
                Ersko Kolo begins moving right with two 4 count <b>kolo steps</b>, continuing
                with two 4 count <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>, then two more <b>kolo steps</b>
                followed by one <b>kolo grapevine</b> and a transition step right and hold for
                counts 2, 3, and 4. Then do the mirror image of the above moving left,
                ending holding your left for counts 2, 3, 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of the dance involves marching forward: right, left, right,
                right hold, then marching backward: left, right, left, left hold. Repeat this
                8 count pattern marching to your right then backward to where you began!
                Repeat the two 8 count patterns of the second part and that is the dance!
                Repeat <i>ad infinitum</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>kolo step</b> inspired its own whole genre of folk dances, and I suspect
                that it also inspired Celtic tribes, migrating west through the Balkans, to
                create their own kolo version, which became Irish dancing.

            <p>
                The music for our second kolo dance is Alunelul.
                The choreography has remained the same at Reed
                since the '50s when I learned it using a 78 rpm
                record for the music.
                The 8 count patterns are all combinations of <b>kolo
                steps + hold steps + stamp-lift steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first pattern is a <b>kolo step</b> moving right: right
                in front, left behind, right in front, left behind, then
                in place step right, hold right while stamp-lift with left,
                hold right while stamp-lift with left again, hold right.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second 8 count pattern is like the first moving
                left! Repeat these two patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third pattern is a reduced <b>kolo step</b> moving
                right: right in front, left behind, right in front, right hold
                while stamp-lift with left, followed by a reduced <b>kolo
                step</b> moving left: left in front, right behind, left in front,
                left hold while stamp-lift with right. Repeat the third
                pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fifth variation in pattern is a further
                reduced kolo: in place step right, hold right while
                stamp-lift with the left, in place step left, hold left
                while stamp-lift with right, step right, hold right while
                stamp-lift left, hold right while stamp-lift left again,
                hold right.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sixth 8 count pattern is like the fifth
                beginning in place step,left .....
                Repeat all until you are the last dancer still standing!
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>kolo step</b> like the <b>buzz step</b> is typically a double
                time step! Not for the timid dancer.
                Sometimes, to emphasize how interchangeable
                <b>kolo and buzz steps</b> are we will do Alunelul using <b>buzz steps</b>
                with clapping instead of stamp-lifts!

            <p>
                Jewish Klezmer music presents an ideal tempo for
                the <b>kolo step</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Pattern in our third kolo dance is constructed
                with two <b>kolo steps</b> moving right. The second 8 counts
                are two: right, left, right, right hold while left foot lifts,
                4 counts moving forward, then 4 counts moving
                backward. The third pattern is two <b>Jewish grapevine
                steps</b> moving left, of course, followed by in place cross
                steps: right crossing left, left in place, right in place, left
                crossing right, right in place, left in place with a two step
                turn around left foot to complete the 8 count pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat these four 8 count patterns. You should be back
                where the dance began!
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part is done marching forward 4 steps then
                in place 4 counts: left hold while pointing right foot to
                right side, left hold again, left hold while pointing right
                foot again, left foot hold. Note, these 4 counts are done
                while remaining on your left foot! The next 8 counts are
                done moving sideways, first to the right: right, left, right
                right hold, then to the left: left, right, left, left hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat this second part, only marching backward 4
                counts with the same 4 counts remaining on your left
                foot and the same 8 count Pattern moving sideways: to
                the right, then to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a glorious, exhilarating dance you will want to do
                <i>ad infinitum</i>!

            <p>
                The more contemporary Israeli music, Hora, inspires
                being expressed with a combination of <b>kolo steps</b> and
                <b>kolo grapevine steps</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It begins with a <b>kolo grapevine</b> in place + 4 steps moving
                forward followed by a <b>kolo grapevine</b> in place and 4 steps
                moving backward to where the dance began.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part moves to the right with a <b>kolo step</b> + a
                <b>kolo grapevine</b>, continuing right with a <b>kolo step</b> + a reduced
                <b>kolo grapevine</b>: right in front, left behind, right behind, right
                hold! Repeat this second part moving left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then repeat the first part twice! followed by a reduced second
                part: <b>kolo step</b> + <b>kolo grapevine</b> continuing right with a
                reduced <b>kolo step</b>: right in front, left behind, right in front,
                right hold! Repeat this reduced second part moving left!
            </p>
            <p>
                That is the dance, but remember to do the first part twice
                after the beginning!

        <h2>Hora Step Folk Dances</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The <b>hora step</b>, like the <b>kolo step</b> and <b>grapevine step</b>,
                is in 4 counts! But, unlike them, not all of the 4 counts
                are expressed with stepping! This break from constant
                stepping 4 counts revolutionized the world of dance
                because it allowed different ethnic groups to express
                their own individuality!
            </p>
            <p>
                And it all began in ancient Greece 3,000 years ago!

        <h2>Greek Hora Dances</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The original Greek <b>hora dance</b> is just one 8 count pattern,
                combining a 4 count <b>marching step</b> moving right with a
                4 count <b>hora step</b> in place facing forward: right in place,
                right hold while lifting left, left in place, left hold while lifting
                right. This pattern is then repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>, or til one
                falls off the edge of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remarkably, this earliest dance is still done today just as
                it was done 3,000 years ago!
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: because the Greek <b>hora step</b> has two non-steps,
                the Greek tradition of patterns beginning with the right
                foot is retained.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wonderful music we use for dancing the Greek hora
                is from an old 78 rpm Greek record I found in a dingy little
                New York subway shop. I only recognized one Greek word
                on the record's label: "syrto". But, that was all I needed to
                know! It has remained my favorite Greek hora music ever
                since.
