Folk Dancing

My priority is to create resources for students that supplement 
the class. The website you have begun should have categories:
Reed Sunday Folk Dance Classes which would include written
introduction to the class and separate descriptions of each 
dance taught + the instructional video for the dance. Eventually,
the website will supersede the video link I've been using.
History of Reed Folk Dancing as a second priority should 
include a written history with accompanying pictures, news
articles, a biographical history, a contemporary history.
A Folk Dancing Directory for other folk dance opportunities 
locally and elsewhere.

For the immediate future, I would like you to focus on the 
first category as a more useful resource for the students.
I will write a general introduction to the class and introductions
to each session, as well as, introductions to each of the dances,
all of which you can critique.

People working on this project will want to know how to use HTML, CSS, git, and sftp.
